<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In venturing to prepare this little volume for
the eyes of the reading public, I am fully
aware of the difficulties of the subject and
the inadequacy of the expressions I have been
able to employ, but I have made the attempt
at the request of those who have found consolation
in some of the thoughts herein
embodied; and the messages left by others
before they passed away, embolden me to
hope that many others may find in this
volume some points of interest which will
help them to appreciate better the "joys"
which this life has for those who know how
to look for them, and that perhaps others may
even gain a clearer conception of that which
awaits us beyond the Veil.</p>

<p>Many of us allow ourselves to be overwhelmed
by the small worries and vexations
of everyday life, clothing them with a reality
quite disproportionate to their importance;
we are too apt to look at them, as it were,
through a powerful microscope, piling power
upon power of magnification, until we have
made mountains out of mole-hills, whereas if
we treated them at their true value we should
look at them through a telescope, in the reverse
direction, when they would appear not
only trivial, but would be seen to be too
remote to have any material effect on our
lives.</p>

<p>The sub-title of this volume, and indeed its
inception, arose from my lately coming in contact
with one of those establishments which
are doing for humanity what a mother's arms
do for the child who is "sick unto death"&mdash;a
beautiful home with cheerful rooms and
cheerful nurses, where patients are tenderly
cared for after severe operations, carried
through by our most famous surgeons, some
cases, alas, almost hopeless from the first. At
the head of this establishment was one of those
kindly self-abnegating personalities, whose
loving sympathy and encouragement have
comforted the dying and smoothed the path
for many a weary pilgrim passing from this
life to the next. With immense responsibilities
on her shoulders, and after a day full
of strenuous work, the head of this establishment
would often sit through the night for
hours by the couch of those whose lives could
not possibly be prolonged for more than a few
days. It was a few simple answers elicited
by the questions brought to me from those
poor sufferers, and the way such answers
seemed to calm anxieties connected with the
fear of death and to render the impenetrable
Veil more transparent, which suggested the
title, "Through a Window in the Blank Wall."</p>

<p>I do not wish to lay claim to having made
any startling discovery; similar thoughts,
especially those concerning the non-reality of
Time and Space, have no doubt occurred to
others, but the whole problem "What is the
Reality?" has been insistently pressing on me
ever since I can remember, and I have tried
to give here in simple colloquial language,
without any attempt at rhetoric, the conclusions
I have personally come to as to what is
the Truth.</p>

<p>The study of ancient and modern philosophic
theories is useful as showing how impossible
it is, for even the greatest thinkers
of any age, to grasp the Absolute with our
understanding or to measure the Infinite
with our finite units. The propounders of
all these theories seem to me to be, without
exception, looking in the wrong direction for
the "Reality of Being"; they are all arguing
from the standpoint of "Intellectualism" in a
similar manner to that of the "Theologians"
referred to in View Three. Our latest expositor
of this, M. Henri Bergson, bases his
theory upon "Life" being the Reality; this
he postulates is a "flowing" in Time, and
<i>Movement</i> therefore becomes for him the
Reality; and yet we know that Motion is but
the product of Time and Space, and these are
only the two modes or <i>limitations</i> under which
our senses act and upon which our very
consciousness of living depends. Surely the
Absolute cannot be localised, must be Omnipresent,
and therefore independent of Space&mdash;cannot
have a beginning or end, must be
Omniscient, and therefore independent of
Time; these two unrealities can therefore
have no existence in "Reality of Being." If,
then, there is any truth in "Intuition," we
have, in this theory, the Reality, "Life," not
only limited by the unreal but actually dependent
for its very existence upon those limitations!
In these Views I have attempted, on the
contrary, to show that Time and Space have no
existence apart from our Physical Senses;
they are the modes only under which we
appreciate motion, or what we call physical
phenomena, and as our conceptional knowledge
is based upon our perceptional knowledge,
our very consciousness of living is
limited by Time and Space, and we must
surely therefore look behind consciousness
itself, beyond the conditioning in Time and
Space for the Reality of Being, otherwise
<i>physical motion</i>, the product of these two
limitations, would become the Reality of
Being.</p>

<p>I have also suggested reasons for looking
upon physical life as a mode of frequency, akin
to Light, Electricity, Magnetism, Chemical
Action, the Vibration of a Tuning Fork, or
the Swing of a Pendulum, and therefore a
transient phenomenon having to do only
with the Race; Life can under these conditions
only be looked upon as a reality in the
same sense in which all other forms of energy
or matter appear real to our finite senses&mdash;namely,
as the shadows or manifestations of
the Absolute on our limited plane of Consciousness.</p>

<p>However strongly I may be convinced&mdash;as I
am&mdash;of the truth of my arguments, and however
sure I may be that many others will not
only agree with my conclusions, but will see
that in "Introspection" rather than in "Intellectualism"
lies the key to the Mystery, I do
not wish to appear dogmatic in any of the
suggestions contained in this volume; I am
stating my own convictions, but at the same
time I fully recognise that the presentation
of the Absolute, with its infinite variety of
aspects, must necessarily be different to every
individual; we are all of the same genus, but
each individual Ego is, as it were, a different
species, and I do not therefore expect that my
attempt to solve the Riddle of the Universe
will appeal to all alike. It is, however, a true
saying that "there is something to be learnt
from every human being," and if I have by
these suggestions succeeded in augmenting
the number of those who have already started
on the true "Quest," and have helped, however
imperfectly, to enrich some lives with
the "joy" of knowing their oneness with the
All-loving, my aim has indeed been attained.</p>

<h1>SCIENCE AND THE INFINITE</h1>




<h3><a name="VIEW_ONE" id="VIEW_ONE"></a>VIEW ONE</h3>

<h2>CLEARING THE APPROACH</h2>


<p>The proof that the Human Race is still in its
infancy may be seen in the fact that we still
require Symbolism to help us to maintain and
carry forward abstract thought to higher
levels, even as children require picture books
for that purpose. The Glamour of Symbolism,
Rapture of Music, and Ideal of Art, which come
to us in later years, had their beginnings when
to the child every blade of grass was a fairy
tale and a grass plot a marvellous fairy forest.
The great aspiration of the Human Race is to
gain a knowledge of the Reality, the Noumenon
behind the phenomenon; but the fact that from
infancy we have been accustomed to confine
our attention wholly to the objective, believing
that to be the reality, has surrounded us with
a concrete boundary wall through which we
can only at times, with difficulty, get transient
glimpses of that which is beyond. It is only in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
recent years that we have been able to realise
that it is the Invisible which is the Real, that
the visible is only its shadow or its manifestation
in the Physical Universe, and that Time
and Space have no existence apart from our
physical senses, in short, that they are only
the modes or limits under which those senses
act or receive their impressions and by which
they are necessarily rendered finite.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that our physical senses
only perceive the surface of our surroundings,
and that we have hitherto been looking at the
Woof of Nature as though it were the glass
of a window covered with patterns, smudges,
flies, &amp;c., comprising all that we call physical
phenomena and which, when analysed in terms
of Time and Space, produce the appearance of
succession and motion. It requires a keener
perception, unbounded by these limitations, to
look through the glass at the Reality which
is beyond. I propose then in a series of short
views, through a window not hitherto unshuttered
and in a direction which I believe
has not before been attempted, to lead those
of my readers who have the necessary aspiration,
patience, and, above all, strenuous persistence,
to a watch-tower, situated well above
the mists and illusions of our ordinary everyday
thoughts, whence they will find it possible
to get a glimpse of a strange new country,
and where those who have by practice once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
attained to its clear perception, will be able to
continue the study by themselves and thus get
further insight into that wonderful region of
Thought which I have called "True Occultism"&mdash;the
knowledge of the Invisible which
is the Real in place of the Visible which is
only its shadow.</p>

<p>Let us first try and understand the conditions
under which phenomena are presented
to us. In our perception of sight, we find the
greater the light, the greater the shadow; a
light placed over a table throws a shadow on
the floor, though not sufficient to prevent our
seeing the pattern of the carpet; increase the
light and the shadow appears now so dark
that no pattern or carpet can be seen; not that
there is now less light under the table but the
light above has to our sense of sight created
or made manifest a greater darkness. Thus,
throughout the Universe, as interpreted by
our Physical Ego, we find phenomena ranging
themselves under the form of positive and
negative, the apparently Real and the Unreal.<br />
The Good making manifest its negative Evil.<br />
The Beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Ugly.<br />
The True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     False.<br />
Knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Ignorance.<br />
Light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Darkness.<br />
Heat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Cold.<br />
But the negatives have no real existence. As
in the case of light we see that the shadow is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
only the absence of light, so the negative of
Goodness, <i>i.e.</i> Evil, may in reality be looked
upon as folly or wasting of opportunity for
exercising the Good. Owing to their limitations
our thoughts are based upon <i>relativity</i>,
and it is hardly thinkable that we could, under
our present conditions, have any cognisance
of the positive without its negative; we shall
in fact see later on that it is by examining
the Physical, the negative or shadow, that we
can best gain a knowledge of the Spiritual,
the positive or real.</p>

<p>The first step to a clear understanding of
this, is to recognise that it is not we who are
looking out upon Nature but that it is the
Reality which is ever trying to enter and
come into touch with us through our senses,
and is persistently trying to waken within us
a knowledge of the sublimest truths. It is
difficult to realise this, as from infancy we
have been accustomed to confine our attention
wholly to the objective, believing that to
be the reality.</p>

<p>Let us try and grasp this fact. If we
analyse our sense of sight, we find that the
only impression made on our bodies by external
objects is the image formed upon the
retina; we have no cognisance of the separate
electro-magnetic rills forming that image,
which, reflected from all parts of an object,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
fall upon the eye at different angles, constituting
form, and with different frequencies
giving colour to that image; that image is
only formed when we turn our eyes in the
right direction to allow those rills to enter;
and, whereas those rills are incessantly beating
on the outside of our sense organ when
the eyelid is closed, they can make no impression
unless we allow them to enter by
raising that shutter. It is not then any
volition from within that goes out to seize
upon and grasp the truths from Nature, but
the phenomena are as it were forcing their
way into our consciousness. This is more
difficult to realise when the object is near to
us, as we are apt to confound it with our
sense of touch, which requires us to stretch
out our hand to the object, but it is clearer
when we take an object far away. In our
telescopes we catch the rills of light which
started from a star a thousand years ago and
the image is still formed on the retina <i>now</i>
although those rills are in fact a thousand
years old and, invisible to our unaided eye,
have been falling upon mankind from the
beginning of life on this globe, trying to get
an entrance to consciousness. It was, however,
only when, by evolution of thought, the
knowledge of optics had produced the telescope
that it became possible not only for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that star to make itself known to us but to
declare to us its distance, its size, and conditions
of existence, and even the different
elemental substances of which it was composed
a thousand years ago. Yet, when we
now allow its image to form on the retina,
our consciousness insists on fixing its attention
upon that star as an outside object, refusing
to allow that it is only an image inside the
eye and making it difficult to realise that that
star may have disappeared and had no existence
for the past 999 years, although in ordinary
parlance we are looking at and seeing
it there now.</p>

<p>I have referred above to the sense of touch;
it is, I think, clear that the first impression a
child can have of sight must take the form
of feeling the image on its retina, as though
the object were actually inside the head, and
it could have no idea that it was outside
until, by touching with the hand, it would
gradually learn by experience that the tangible
outside object corresponded with the image
located in the head; this is fully borne out by
the testimony of men who, born blind, have,
by an operation, received their sight late in
life; in each case their first experience of
seeing gave the impression that the object
was touching the eye, and they were quite
unable to recognise by sight an object such
as a cup or plate or a round ball which they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
commonly handled and knew perfectly well
by touch; in fact, the idea of an object formed
by the sense of touch is so absolutely different
to that formed by the sense of sight that it
would be impossible without past experience
to conclude that the two sensations referred
to one and the same object. The image formed
on the retina has nothing in common with
the sense of hardness, coldness, and weight
experienced by touch, the only impression on
the retina being that of colour or shade, and
an outline; it is, however, hardly conceivable
that even the outline of form would be recognised
by the eye until touch had proved
that form comprised also solidity and that
the two ideas had certain motions in common
both in duration in Time and extension in
Space.</p>

<p>Again, our senses of sight and hearing are
alike based on the appreciation of frequencies
of different rapidity; brightness and colour
in light are equivalent to loudness and pitch
in sound, but in sound we have no equivalent
to perception of form or situation in space;
it gives us no knowledge of the existence of
objects when situated at great distances, nor
can movements be followed even at short distances
without having material contact, by
means of the air, with the object; sight indeed
appears to have to do with Space- and sound
with Time-perception. In examining Nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
by means of our senses we find we are so
hemmed in by what we have always taken
for granted and so bound down by modes
of reasoning derived from what we have seen,
heard, or felt in our daily life, that we are
sadly hampered in our search after the truth.
It is difficult to sweep the erroneous concepts
aside and make a fresh start. In fact the
great difficulty in studying the Reality underlying
Nature is analogous to our inability to
isolate and study the different sounds themselves
which fall upon the ear, if our own
language is being uttered, without being
forced to consider the meaning we have
always attached to those sounds.</p>

<p>Let us now go back to the contention that
it is not we who are looking out upon Nature
but that our senses are being bombarded from
without; we are living in a world of continuous
and multitudinous changes, and as
our senses require change or motion for their
excitation, without those changes we could
have no cognisance of our surroundings, we
should have no consciousness of living; but
if we base our thought entirely on sense perception,
taking for granted that Time and
Space have reality instead of recognising that
they are only modes or limits under which
those senses act, the Wall will ever remain
opaque to us. Let us try and make this
clearer. If we analyse the impression we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
receive from Motion, we find it is made up
of the product of our two limitations, it is
the time that an object takes to go over a
certain space. We must come therefore to the
conclusion also that Motion itself has no existence
in reality apart from our senses. The
result of not being able to appreciate this, is
that the finiteness of our sense, caused by its
dependence on Motion for excitation, surrounds
us with illusions; one of these illusions is what
we call solidity or continuity of sensation. If
you hold a cannon-ball in your hand, perception
by the sense of touch tells you that it is
continuous, or what is called solid and hard;
but it is not so in reality except as a concept
limited by our finite senses. A fair analogy
would be to liken it to a swarm of bees, for
we know that it is composed of an immense
number of independent atoms or molecules
which are darting about, and circling round
each other at an enormous speed but never
touching; they are also pulsating at a definite
enormous rate; we can at will increase their
motion by heat or reduce by cold; if our touch
perception were sensitive enough we should
feel those motions and should not have the
sensation of a solid. We have a similar case
of limitation in our other senses, which we
shall grasp better in another View through our
Window. We can hear beats only up to fifteen
in a second, beyond that number they give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
sensation of a musical or continuous sound.
In our sense of sight we can see pulsations
or intermittent flashes up to only six in a
second, beyond that number they give the
sensation of a continuous light; a gas jet,
if extinguished and relit six times in a second,
can be seen to flicker, but beyond that rate
is to our sense of sight a steady flame. The
effect may also be shown by making the
top of a match red-hot; when stationary or
moving slowly, it is a point of light, but,
moved quickly, it becomes a continuous line
of light.</p>

<p>Even apart from our senses we find Motion
giving the characteristics of solidity: a wheel
with only a few spokes, if rotated quickly
enough, becomes quite impermeable to any
substance, however small, thrown at it; a thin
jet of water only half an inch in diameter, if
discharged at great pressure equivalent to a
column of water of 500 metres, cannot be
cut even with an axe, it resists as though it
were made of the hardest steel; a thin cord,
hanging from a vertical axis, and being revolved
very quickly, becomes rigid, and if
struck with a hammer it resists and resounds
like a rod of wood; a thin chain and even a
loop of string, if revolved at great speed
over a vertical pulley, becomes rigid and, if
allowed to escape from the pulley, will run
along the ground as a hoop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Now with regard to this limit of time
perception, which gives us the phenomenon
of Solidity, I have lately been able to devise
an arrangement which, acting as a microscope
for Time, gives the sensation of an
increase in sight perception up to several
thousand units per second; it is based on
the fact that though the eye can only see
six times per second it can see for the one-millionth
part of a second. An example of
this is the well-known experiment of seeing
a bullet in its flight; the bullet makes electrical
connection resulting in a spark which
illuminates the bullet when opposite the eye.
The electrical spark exists only for the millionth
of a second, and as the bullet in that
time has no perceptible movement it is seen
standing absolutely still with all marks upon
it quite visible to the eye. When Sight perception
is increased up to the rate at which
time may be said to flow for any particular
object we apparently get into the reality, the
permanent <i>now</i> where motion ceases to exist
as a sensation. A tuning-fork, kept vibrating,
by means of an electro-magnet, at 2000
times per second, may to our sense of sight
be gradually slowed down and, optically,
brought absolutely to a standstill, for as long
as desired, and the smallest irregularity of
its surface may be minutely examined,
though it continues to be heard and felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
vibrating at that enormous rate. I have
made several experiments in this direction,
and some very curious facts connected with
the sensation of Motion are brought to
light by means of this increase in perceptive
power. If the sense of sight is increased to
125 units per second, motion at the rate of
one inch per second is barely visible; taking
the common house-fly, whose wings vibrate
about 400 times per second, its units of perception
would appear to be about two-thirds
of those beats, as I found it had no cognisance
of Motion below two inches per second;
you can put your finger on any fly provided
you do not approach it faster than the above
rate, it turns its head up to look at your
finger but can see no motion in it; if you
approach at over three inches per second it
will always fly away before you are within a
foot. I found that a dragon-fly, whose wings
vibrate about 200 times per second, had only
half the number of unit perceptions of the
fly and could apparently see motion at about
one inch per second but not under. In the converse
of the above we have then the principle
of a Microscope for Time, somewhat similar
to the Microscope for Space of our laboratories.
If our perception were increased
sufficiently we could slow down any motion
for examination, however rapid; there would
be no difficulty in following a lightning flash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
or even arresting its visible motion for purposes
of investigation without interfering
with the natural sequence of cause and
effect.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, our perception were
decreased below six times per second, all
motion would be accelerated, until with perception
reduced to one unit in twenty-four
hours the sun would appear only as a band
across the sky, and we could not follow its
motion any more than, as we have seen, we
could follow the point of a red-hot match. If
perception were reduced far enough, plants and
trees would grow up visibly before our eyes.
But we must leave this subject now, as this
and the Time Microscope will be treated in a
later View.</p>

<p>Let us try and appreciate the fact that,
under our present conditions, our conceptions
of the immense and minute&mdash;namely, extension
in Space, and that of quick and slow or
duration in Time&mdash;are purely relative, and
that from this arise those pseudo-conceptions
which we call the infinitely extended and the
infinitely lasting. Under our present limitations
it is impossible for us to grasp the whole
of any Truth, if we could do that, there would
be no such mystery of Infinity to puzzle us;
we could, as it were, see all around it, but
that is again looking through another window.
We are now considering <i>relativity</i>. If we cut off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the very end of the point of the finest needle,
we get so minute a particle of steel that it is
hardly visible to the naked eye, and yet we
know that that small speck contains not only
millions but millions of millions of what are
called atoms, all in intense motion and never
touching each other. Try and conceive how
small each of these atoms must be, and then
try and grasp the fact, only lately proved by
the discovery of Radio-activity, that each of
these atoms is a great family made up of
bodies analogous to the planets of our solar
system and whose rate of motion is comparable
only to that of Light. This is not theory,
it is fact clearly demonstrated to us by the
study of Radio-activity. Curiously enough,
we know more about these bodies than we do
of the atom itself; we actually know their size
and weight and the speed with which they
move. We do not yet know what is at the
centre of this system, but we do know that
each of these bodies is as far away from the
centre as our planet is from the sun (93,000,000
miles), and as far from its neighbours as our
planet is, <i>relatively to its size</i>. And now, for the
purpose of grasping this subject of relativity,
I want you to ask yourself whether it is conceivable
that a world, so small as those bodies
are, could possibly be inhabited by sentient
beings. Leaving you to form your own conclusion
upon this point, I will ask you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
follow me down another path leading to the
elucidation of the same subject.</p>

<p>If at this moment we and all our surroundings
were reduced to half their size and everything
were moving twice as quickly, we should
absolutely have no cognisance of any change,
neither could we possibly note any difference
if everything were reduced to a hundredth
part of the original size and were going a
hundred times quicker; and even when reduced
a thousand or a million times, or to such
minuteness that the whole of our solar system
with its revolving planets became no larger
than one of those atoms in the needle point,
and the whole of the starry universe therefore
reduced to the size of the needle point, its
millions of suns coinciding with the millions
of planetary systems in that steel particle&mdash;our
earth would still revolve round the sun,
though no larger than one of those minute
planetary particles and travelling at the rate
of light, but we should still have no knowledge
of any change, in fact, our life would go
on as usual, though it was difficult a few
minutes ago to think it conceivable that so
small a globe could be inhabited by sentient
beings.</p>

<p>Once more let us consider that the change
is made in the direction of expansion in space
and slowing down of Time; let all our surroundings
be so enormously increased that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
each of the atoms in the steel point became
as large as our solar system and the steel
point as large as the visible universe, each
atom therefore taking the place of a star, and
motion being reduced in proportion; it is still
absolutely inconceivable that we could know
of any change having taken place, though the
length of our needle, which was at first, say,
one inch, would now be so great that light,
travelling 186,000 miles per second, would take
500,000 years to traverse its length, and the
stature of each one of us would be so great
that light would require over 36,000,000 years
to travel from head to foot, and that 36,000,000
years would have to be multiplied 163,000,000
times, making 5860 millions of millions of
years to represent the time that an ordinary
<i>sneeze</i> would take under such conditions. And
yet we have only gone towards the infinitely
great exactly as far as we at first went towards
the infinitely small, and it is still absolutely
inconceivable that we could be conscious
of any change, our everyday life would go on
as usual, we should be quite oblivious to the
fact that every second of time, with all its
incidents and thoughts, had been lengthened
to 5860 millions of millions of years. Do we
not now begin to grasp the fact that immensity
and minuteness in extension, and motion
in duration, are figments only of our finite
minds, that Time and Space have no objective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
reality apart from our physical senses, that
they are only the modes under which we receive
impressions of our surroundings? With
perfect perception we should know that the
only Reality is the Spiritual, the Here comprising
all Space and the Now all Time.</p>

<p>One more look through the window before
we part, and we may see what I consider the
greatest miracle in our everyday life: The
Inner-self of each one of us, being part of the
Reality or Spiritual, is independent of Space
limitations and must therefore be <i>Omnipresent</i>,
is independent of Time and therefore
<i>Omniscient</i>. This inevitable deduction will be
explained more fully in another View.</p>

<p>It is from this store of knowledge that
our Physical Ego is ever trying to win fresh
forms of thought, and, in response to our
persistent endeavours, that Inner-self, from
time to time, buds out a new thought; the
Physical Ego has already prepared the clothing
with which that bud must be clad before
it can come into conscious thought, because, as
Max M&uuml;ller has shown us, we have to form
words before we can think; so does the
Physical Ego clothe that ethereal thought in
physical language, and by means of its organ
of speech it sends that thought forth into the
air in the form of hundreds of thousands of
vibrations of different shapes and sizes, some
large, some small, some quick, some slow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
travelling in all directions and filling the surrounding
space; there is nothing in those
vibrations but physical movement, but each
separate movement is an integral part or
thread of that clothing. Another Physical
Ego receives these multitudinous vibrations
by means of its sense organ, weaves them
together into the same physical garment, and
actually becomes possessed of that ethereal
thought&mdash;an unexplained marvel, and probably
the most wonderful occurrence in our
daily existence, especially as it often enables
the second Physical Ego to gain fresh knowledge
from its own Real Personality. Now,
in connection with this, consider the fact,
already emphasized, that it is not we who are
looking out upon Nature, but that it is the
Reality which is ever trying to make itself
known to us by bombarding our sense organs
with the particular physical impulses to which
those organs can respond, and, if we aspire
to gain a knowledge of what is behind the
physical, it is clear that all our endeavours
must be towards weaving these impulses into
garments and then learning from them the
sublime Truths which the Reality is ever
trying to divulge to us.</p>

<h3><a name="VIEW_TWO" id="VIEW_TWO"></a>VIEW TWO</h3>

<h2>THE VISION</h2>


<p>"Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,"
is in true consonance with the old philosophic
dictum that "Everything in heaven must have
its counterpart on earth"; in other words, the
Reality has all Its multitudinous manifestations,
every noumenon its phenomenon, in
the physical universe. If we now examine
those traits of our surroundings which affect
us most, and best help us to reach the highest
level of abstract thought of which our nature
is capable, we find that it is the recognition
of the Beauty (comprising also the Good and
the True) in everything, which constitutes the
power held over our minds by what we may
call the Glamour of Symbolism, the Rapture
of Music, and the Ideal of Art. But this influence
is still only <i>sensuous</i>, it does not carry
us beyond the extension of that Wonderment
and Enchantment which had their birth with
our first visit to Fairyland. This is, I think,
evident, as Beauty is not the Reality; it is
only what may be called the sensuous expression
of the Reality or Spiritual on the physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
plane. Although we have no words to express,
nor indeed minds to grasp, the wonders and
glories of that which is behind the Veil, it is
possible for some of us to get a glimpse of
it through our Window, and to those the following
pages may be helpful, but to others
the Wall will remain blank; and, here at the
commencement, I should like to warn those
who have not been through a certain experience,
to which I shall refer, that no words
of mine will open the Window for them;
at the same time it is probable that many
of my readers, who think at this stage that
they have no knowledge of the subject of
this View, will, as we proceed, recognise in
the view through the Window something they
have experienced more than once in their
lifetime, and to these I address myself.</p>

<p>Let us first try to understand what we
know concerning ourselves. The longer one
lives and the more one studies the mystery
of "Being," the more one is forced to the
conclusion that in every Human Being there
are two Personalities, call them what you
like&mdash;"the <i>Real</i> and its Image," "the <i>Spiritual</i>
and its Material Shadow," or "the <i>Transcendental</i>
and its Physical Ego." The former in
each of these duads is, as referred to in our first
View, not conditioned in Time and Space, is
independent of Extension and Duration, and
must therefore be Omnipresent and Omniscient,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
whereas the latter, being subservient
to Time and Space, can only think in finite
words, requires succession of ideas to accumulate
knowledge, is dependent on perception
of movements for forming concepts of its
surroundings, and, without this perception,
it would have no knowledge of existence.</p>

<p>Let us go back into the far distant past,
before the frame and brain of what we now
call the genus Homo was fully developed: he
was then an animal pure and simple, conscious
of living but knowing neither good nor evil;
there was nothing in his thoughts more perfect
than himself; it was the golden age of innocency;
he was a being enjoying himself in a
perfect state of nature with absolute freedom
from responsibility of action. But, as ages
rolled on, under the great law of evolution, his
brain was enlarging and gradually being prepared
for a great and wonderful event, which
was to make an enormous change in his mode
of living and his outlook on the future. As
seeds may fall continually for thousands of
years upon hard rock without being able to
germinate, until gradually, by the disintegration
of the rock, soil is formed, enabling the
seed at last to take root; so for countless ages
was the mind of that noble animal being
prepared until, in the fulfilment of time, the
Spiritual took root and he became a living
soul. The change was marvellous; he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
now aware of something higher and more perfect
than himself, he found that he was able
to form ideals above his ability to attain to,
resulting in a sense of inferiority, akin to a
"Fall"; he was conscious of the difference of
Right and Wrong, and felt happy and blessed
when he followed the Good, but ashamed and
accursed when he chose the Evil; he became
upright in stature, and able to communicate
his thoughts and wishes to his fellows by
means of language; and by feeling his freedom
to choose between the Good, Beautiful,
and True on one hand, and the Evil, Ugly,
and False on the other, he became aware
that he was responsible and answerable to
a mysterious higher Being for his actions.
This at once raised him far above other
animals, and he gradually began to feel the
presence within him of a wonderful power,
the nucleus of that Transcendental Self which
had taken root, and which, from that age to
this, has urged Man ever forward first to
form, and then struggle to attain, higher
Ideals of Perfection. As a mountaineer who,
with stern persistence, struggles upward from
height to height, gaining at each step a clearer
and broader view, so do we, as we progress
in our struggle upwards, toward the understanding
of Perfection, ever see more and more
clearly that the Invisible is the Real, that the
visible is only its shadow, that our Spiritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Personality is akin to that Great Reality,
that we cannot search out and know that
Personality; it is not an idea, it cannot be
perceived by our senses, any more than we
can see a sound by our sense of sight or
measure an Infinity by our finite units; all
we can so far do is to feel and mark its
effect in guiding our Physical Ego to choose
the real from the shadow, the plus from
the minus, receiving back in some marvellous
mode of reflex action the power to draw
further nourishment from the Infinite. As
that Inner Personality becomes more and
more firmly established, higher ideals and
knowledge of the Reality bud out, and, as
these require the clothing of finite expressions
before they can become part of our
consciousness, so are they clothed by our
Physical Ego and become forms of thought;
and, although the Physical Ego is only the
shadow or image, projected on the physical
screen, of the Real Personality, we are able,
by examining these emanations and marking
their affinity to the Good, the Beautiful,
and the True, to attain at times to more than
transient glimpses of the loveliness of that
which is behind the veil. As in a river flowing
down to the sea, a small eddy, however
small, once started with power to increase,
may, if it continues in midstream, instead of
getting entangled with the weeds and pebbles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
near the bank, gather to itself so large a
volume of water, that, when it reaches the
sea, it has become a great independent force;
so is each of us endowed, as we come into this
life, with a spark of the Great Reality, with
potential force to draw from the Infinite in
proportion to our conscientious endeavours to
keep ourselves free from the deadening effects
of mundane frivolities and enticements, turning
our faces ever towards the light rather
than to the shadow, until our personality
becomes a permanent entity, commanding an
individual existence when the physical clothing
of this life is worn out, and for us all
shadows disappear.</p>

<p>If man became a conscious being on some
such analogous lines as indicated, it is clear
that he is, as it were, the offspring of two
distinct natures, and subject to two widely
separated influences; the Spiritual ever urging
him towards improvement in the direction
of the Real or Perfect, and the Physical or
Animal instincts inviting him in the opposite
direction. These latter instincts are not wrong
in themselves, in a purely animal nature, but
are made manifest as urging him in the direction
of the shadow or Imperfect when they
come in contact, and therefore in competition,
with the Spiritual. Neither the Spiritual nor
the Physical can be said to possess Free-will;
they must work in opposite directions, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
this competition for influence over our actions
provides the basis for the exercise of man's
Free-will&mdash;the choice between progression and
stagnation. The Spiritual influence must conquer
in the long run, as every step under that
influence is a step towards the Real and can
never be lost; the apparent steps in the other
direction are only negative or retarding, and
can have no real existence, except as a drag
on the wheel which is always moving in the
direction of Perfection, thus hindering the
process of growth of the Personality.</p>

<p>The stages in development of the Physical
Ego and its final absorption in the Transcendental
may perhaps be stated as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>The Physical Ego loquitur:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I become aware of being surrounded by
phenomena, I will to see&mdash;I perceive and
wonder what is the meaning of everything&mdash;I
begin to think&mdash;I reflect by combining
former experiences&mdash;I am conscious that I
am, and that I am free to choose between
Right and Wrong, but that I am responsible
for my actions to a Higher Power; that what
I call 'I am' is itself only the shadow, or
in some incomprehensible sense the breathing
organ, of a wonderful divine Afflatus
or Power which is growing up within, or in
intimate connection with me, and which itself
is akin to the Reality. Owing to my senses
being finite I cannot with my utmost thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
form a direct concept of that power, although I
feel that it comprises all that is good and real in
me, and is in fact my true personality; I am
conscious of it ever urging me forward towards
the Good, Beautiful, and True, and that each
step I take in that direction (especially when
taken in opposition to the dictates of physical
instincts) results in a further growth of that
Transcendental Self. With that growth I
recognise that it is steadily gaining power
over my thoughts and aspirations. I learn
that the whole physical Universe is a manifestation
of the Will of the Spiritual, that
every phenomenon is as it were a sublime
thought, that it should be my greatest individual
aspiration to try to interpret those
thoughts, or when, as it seems at present, our
stage in the evolution of thought is not far
enough advanced, I should during my short
term of life do my best to help forward the
knowledge of the Good, Beautiful, and True
for those who come after. As I grow old the
Real Ego in me seems to be taking my place,
the central activity of my life is being shifted,
as I feel I am growing in some way independent
of earthly desires and aspirations, and, when
the term of my temporary sojourn here draws
to a close, I feel myself slackening my hold
of the physical until at last I leave go entirely,
and my physical clothing, having fulfilled its
use, drops off and passes away, carrying with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
it all limitations of Time and Space. I awake
as from a dream to find my true heritage in
the Spiritual Universe."</p></div>

<p>If we try to form a conception of the stages
of growth of the Transcendental Self it would,
I think, be somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="love">
<tr><td align='left'>The first consciousness of the Spiritual entity would be....</td><td align='left'>I know that Love is the Summum Bonum.</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>As it became nourished it would be....</td> <td align='left'>I love.</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>Then....</td><td align='left'>I love with my whole being.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Then....</td><td align='left'>I know that I am part of God and God is Love.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>And lastly....</td><td align='left'>I am perfected in Loving and Knowing.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>And the above is the best description I have
been able to formulate of the development
of the Mystical Sense by means of which
we can get a view of the Reality through
our Window. I will try to give my own
experience of this, which will, I know, wake
an echo in other hearts, as I have met
those who have felt the same. From a
child I always had an intense feeling that
Love was the one thing above all worth
having in life, and, as I grew older and became
aware that my real self was akin to the
Great Spirit, at certain times of elation or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
what might be called a kind of ecstasy, I had
an overpowering sense of longing for union
with the Reality, an intense love and craving
to become one with the All-loving. When
analysed later in life this was recognised as
similar in kind, though different in degree,
to the feeling which, when in the country,
surrounded by charming scenery, wild flowers,
the depths of a forest glade, or even the gentle
splash of a mountain stream, makes one
always want to open one's arms wide to embrace
and hold fast the beautiful in Nature,
as though one's Physical Ego, wooed by the
Beautiful which is the sensuous (not sensual)
expression of the Spiritual, longed to become
one with the Physical, as the Personality or
Transcendental Ego craves to become one
with the Reality. It is the same intense feeling
which makes a lover, looking into the eyes
of his beloved, long to become united in the
perfection of loving and knowing, to be one
with that being in whom he has discovered a
likeness akin to the highest ideal of which he
himself is capable of forming a conception.</p>

<p>As in heaven, so on earth the Physical Ego,
though only a shadow, has in its sphere the
same fundamental characteristic craving as
the Transcendental Personality has for that
which is akin to it, and it is this wonderful
love that, as the old adage says, makes the
world go round. It is the most powerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
incentive on earth, and is implanted in our
natures for the good and furtherance of the
race; it is, in fact, the manifestation on the
material plane of that craving of the Inner
self for union with, and being perfected in
loving and knowing, that Infinite Love of
which it is itself the likeness. If we can
realise that everything on the physical plane
is a shadow, symbol, or manifestation of that
which is in the Transcendental, the Mystical
Sense, through contemplating these as symbols,
enables us at certain times, alas! too
seldom and fleeting in character, to get beyond
the Physical; but those of my readers
who have been <i>there</i> will know how impossible
it is to describe, in direct words, which
would carry any meaning, either the path
by which the experience is gained or a true
account of the experience itself. I will try,
however, and I think I may be able to lead
my readers, by indirect inductive suggestion,
to a view of even these difficult subjects,
by using the knowledge we have
already gained in our first view through
this Window. If an artist were required to
draw a representation of the Omniscient
Transcendental Self, budding out new forms
of thought in response to the conscientious
efforts of, and the providing of suitable clothing
by, the Physical Ego, as referred to in
View No. 1, he would be obliged to make use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of symbolic forms, and I want to make it
quite clear that the description I am attempting
must necessarily be clothed in symbolic
language and reasoning, and must not be
taken as in any way the key by which the
door of "the sanctuary" may be opened; it is
only possible by it to help the mind to grasp
the fact that there is a Window through which
such things may be seen, the rest depends
upon the personality of the seer.</p>

<p>Now bear in mind that it is not we who are
looking out upon Nature, but that it is the
Reality, which, by means of the physical, is persistently
striving to enter into our consciousness,
to tell us what? &#920;&#949;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951; &#949;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; (God is
Love). As in Thompson's suggestive poem,
"The Hound of Heaven"&mdash;the Hidden which
desires to be found&mdash;the Reality is ever hunting
us, and will never leave us till He has taught
us to know and therefore to love Him, and, as
seen in our first view, the first step is to try
to see through the woof of nature to the
Reality beyond. To this may also be added
the attempt to hear the "silence" beyond the
audible. Try now to look upon the whole
"visible" as a background comprising landscape,
sea, and sky&mdash;we shall get help in this
direction in a later View&mdash;and then bring that
background nearer and nearer to your consciousness.
It requires practice, but it can be
done; it may help you if you remember the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
fact that the whole of that visible scene is
actually depicted on the <i>surface</i> of your retina
and <i>has no other existence for you</i>. The nearer
you can get the background to approach, the
more clearly you can see that the whole
physical world of our senses is but a thin veil,
a mere soap film, which at death is pricked and
parts asunder, leaving us in the presence of the
Reality underlying all phenomena. The same
may be accomplished with the "audible,"
which is indeed part of the same physical
film, though this is not at first easy to recognise.
As pointed out in View No. 1, there is
little in common between our sense of sight
and hearing; but the chirp of birds, the hum
of bees, the rustle of wind in the leaves,
the ripple of a stream, the distant sound of
sheep bells, and lowing of cattle form a background
of sound which may be coaxed to
approach you; the only knowledge you have
of such sounds is their impression or image on
the flat tympanum of your ear; they have <i>no
other existence for you</i>; and again you may
recognise that the physical is but a thin transient
film. With the approach of the physical
film all material sensation becomes as it were
blurred, as near objects become when the eye
looks at the horizon, and gradually escapes
from consciousness.</p>

<p>I have tried in the foregoing to suggest a
method by which our Window may be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>unshuttered;
it has necessarily been only an
oblique view and clothed in symbolic phraseology,
but those who have been able to grasp
its meaning will now have attained to what
may be called a state of <i>self-forgetting</i>, the
silencing or quieting down of the Physical
Ego; sight and sound perceptions have been
put in the background of consciousness, and it
becomes possible to worship or love the very
essence of beauty without the distraction of
sense analysis and synthesis or temptation to
form intellectual conceptions.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to attempt the last
aspect of our view&mdash;namely, the description
of what is experienced when the physical
mists have been evaporated by the Mystical
Sense. Again we find that no direct description
is possible, language is absolutely
inadequate to describe the unspeakable, communications
have to be physically transmitted
in words to which finite physical meanings
have been allocated. The still small voice
which may at times of Rapture be momentarily
experienced in Music, is something much
more wonderful than can be formed by sounds,
and this perhaps comes nearest to the expression
necessary for depicting the vision of
the soul; but it cannot be held or described, it
is quickly drowned by the physical sense of
audition. As the Glamour of Symbolism can
only be transmitted to one who has passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the portal of Symbolic Thought, the Rapture
of Music can only be truly understood by one
who has already experienced it, and the Ideal
of Art requires a true artistic temperament to
comprehend it, so it is, I believe, impossible
to describe, with any chance of success, this
wonderful experience to any but those whom
Mr. A. C. Benson, in his <i>Secret of the Thread
of Gold</i>, very aptly describes as having already
entered "the Shrine." Those who have been
<i>there</i> will know that it is not at all equivalent
to a vision, it is not anything which can be
seen or heard or felt by touch; it is entirely
independent of the physical senses; it is not
Giving or Receiving, it is not even a receiving
of some new knowledge from the Reality; it
has nothing to do with thought or intellectual
gymnastics; all such are seen to be but mist.
The nearest description I can formulate is:&mdash;A
wondrous feeling of perfect peace;&mdash;absolute
rest from physical interference;&mdash;perfect contentment;&mdash;the
sense of Being-one-with-the-Reality,
carrying with it a knowledge that
the Reality or Spiritual is nearer to us and
has much more to do with us than the
Physical has, if we could only see the truth
and recognise its presence;&mdash;that there is no
real death;&mdash;no finiteness and yet no Infinity;&mdash;that
the Great Spirit cannot be localised or
said to be anywhere, but that everywhere is
God;&mdash;that the whole of what we call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Creation is an instantaneous Thought of the
Reality;&mdash;that it is only by the process of
analysing in Time and Space that we imagine
there is such a thing as succession of events;&mdash;that
the only Reality is the <i>Spiritual</i>, the
<i>Here</i> embracing all Space and the <i>Now</i> embracing
all Time.</p>

<p>How few of us who are now drawing
towards the end of our sojourn here, have
not, at certain times during our lives, experienced
something akin to what I have
tried to put before you in the above! Does
not a particular scent, a beautiful country
scene, a phrase in music, the beauty or pathos
in a picture, symbolic sculpture in a grand
cathedral, or even a chance word spoken in
our hearing, every now and then waken in
our innermost consciousness an enchanting
memory of some wonderful happy moment
of the past when the sun seemed to have been
shining more brightly, the birds singing more
merrily, when everything in nature seemed
more alive, and our very beings seemed
wrapped up in an intense love of our surroundings?
On those occasions we were not
far from seeing behind the veil, though we
did not recognise it at the time; but when we
now look back, with experience gained by
advancing years, and consider those visions
of the past, we cannot help seeing that the
physical film was to our eyes more transparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
at those times, and the very joy of their remembrance
seems to be giving us a prescience
of that which we shall experience, when for
each one of us the physical film is pricked and
passes away like a scroll.</p>

<h3><a name="VIEW_THREE" id="VIEW_THREE"></a>VIEW THREE</h3>

<h2>MYSTICISM AND SYMBOLISM</h2>


<p>"Who can doubt that the Mystics know more
than the Theologians, and that the Poets know
more than the Scientists? for this inner apprehension
is surely the highest and truest kind
of Knowledge." Such were the words written
to me lately by a clergyman of great learning
and of unimpeachable orthodoxy, whose
mature knowledge of the Higher Mysteries
has been gained by a life-long study of the
Divine. In View No. 1 we saw that the first
step towards opening our Window, was to
grasp the fact that it is not we who are <i>looking
out</i> upon Nature, but that it is the Reality
which is ever trying to enter and to <i>come into</i>
touch with us, through our senses, and is persistently
trying to wake within us a knowledge
of the sublimest truths: but this has
not yet been appreciated by the Theologian;
he is looking <i>outwards</i> instead of <i>inwards</i>,
and asks the question, based on <i>intellectual</i>
conception, in the form "Can I find out the
Absolute so that I may possess Him?" and
the answer ever comes back, "<i>No</i>, because I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
am trying to storm the <i>Sanctuary</i> of the Unthinkable,
the Infinite, by means of a Ladder
which cannot reach beyond our finite conceptions,
and can deal therefore only with the
shadows, cast by the outlying ramparts, upon
our physical plane." An example of this is
surely seen in the lecture lately delivered by
the Bishop of Oxford (Dr. Gore) to the University
of Oxford (13th February 1912, reported
in the <i>Guardian</i> of 16th February),
when he made the statement that the greatest
difficulty we have is to recognise that the
Absolute is a God of Love. His exact words
were: "I believe that there are a great many
of us who know, perhaps from bitter experience,
that whatever difficulties there are about
religious belief are difficulties about believing
in a God of Love; whatever is our experience,
and however sunny is our disposition, any
steady thinking will make it apparent that
thought, apart from the Christian revelation,
presumed and accepted, or reflected unconsciously,
has never got at it, and even after it
has been in the world, thought is continually
finding it hard to retain the idea of God the
Creator, or the truth that God is Love, partly
owing to the limitations of human thinking,
partly, and even more, owing to the experience
of man and of nature."</p>

<p>On the other hand the Mystic, with <i>introspection</i>,
asks the question in the form "Can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the Absolute find me out and possess me and
thus make me feel that that which is within
me is akin to, is, in fact, a part of Him and
that I am possessed thereby?" and the answer
ever comes back from those who are on the
true Quest:&mdash;"<i>Yes</i>; because the Unthinkable,
the Hidden which desires to be found, is
ever trying to come into our Consciousness to
waken the knowledge that His <i>Sanctuary</i>, or
what is called the Kingdom of Heaven, is
within us, that we are not an external but an
internal creation of the All-loving." Such a
realisation is, as pointed out in "The Vision,"
far above Analysis and Synthesis or Intellectual
gymnastics, which can deal only with
the finite and are seen to be but Mist. How
many valuable thoughts are wrecked and lost
from our inability to formulate and describe
them intellectually, even in our own consciousness.
We are too apt to lay the blame upon,
and to doubt, the Truth of those conceptions,
because we are unable to find words to express
them; the very act of attempting to analyse
such thoughts in Time and Space destroys our
power of carrying them to higher levels.
Those who have once realised that the knowledge
of the Absolute is the true Divine Life
within us, can, as we have seen, at certain
times and under certain conditions, experience
that wonderful joy of perception by
means of what I have called the Eye of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Soul; but that is missed by those who are
always asking questions, and arguing, about
what that knowledge consists in; the command
"Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be
opened unto you, ask and it shall be given
you," was not meant for the intellect but for
the Heart, not for logical controversy but for
inward discernment, not for physical enjoyment
but for the nourishment of the Transcendental
Ego. All things <i>may</i> be possible
to him that believeth, but how much more is
this true of him who, as referred to in View
No. 2, is perfected in "Loving and Knowing."
The nearer we get to that consciousness of
Being-one-with-the-Reality, the more we
see and can meditate upon the wonderful
"joy" which permeates all creation; but
without that consciousness it is invisible, and
the world is dark and evil and unloving, and
to many, alas! appears more the handiwork
of a Devil than of a God of Love.</p>

<p>Mysticism is not, as the man in the street
generally thinks, the study of the "Mysterious,"
but is the attempt to gain a knowledge
of the Reality, the ultimate Truth in everything,
especially the perception of that wonderful
Transcendental Power which is growing
up within, or in close connection with, each
one of us. The study of the Physical Sciences,
as also of the various forms of Religion
around us, is useful and fascinating in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
domain of "Intellectualism," but does not
take us far towards the goal of our aspirations.
I shall, however, attempt to show, in
my next View, that by examining the phenomena
of Nature and realising that they are
symbols only of the Noumenon, the Reality,
which is behind them, it is possible to reach a
point where we may even feel that we are
thinking, or having divulged to us, what may
be called the very thoughts of the Absolute.
We shall see that this can only be accomplished
by first recognising that the Invisible is the
Real, that the visible is only its shadow,
that all our surroundings are but the images,
or outlines, of the Reality cast on the Physical
plane of our Senses; to accomplish this, we
have to understand the use of <i>Symbolic</i>
Thought for sustaining and carrying conceptions
to a higher level; because, as
already explained, we can only express and,
indeed, think of the Invisible or Infinite
under terms of the Visible or Finite. Let me
give you a glimpse at what may be called
the "Glamour of Symbolism"; it is difficult to
explain to those who have not yet thought of
or felt it, but the following may be helpful:</p>

<p>Think of the loveliest story or poem you
have ever read, the most entrancing music you
have ever heard, or the most beautiful paintings
you have ever seen, and think how, at
the end, you experienced a wonderful glow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
enchantment with the concept as a whole, apart
from specialising any particular character or
event in the story, phrase in the music, or subject
in the pictures; then do the same with one
of those wonderful cathedrals of the twelfth to
fourteenth centuries, the epoch of that beautiful
Gothic style which I shall show was
founded upon the highest mystical form of
Symbolism possible to those who lived at the
then zenith of Mystical Thought in the history
of the world. The number of cathedrals built
during those three centuries was so prodigious
that, without the documentary evidence which
we have, it would be absolutely incredible.
Every part of those buildings, even to the
smallest decorations, was, as shown by any of
the old writers on Religious Symbolism, such as
Durandus, planned to symbolise some beautiful
thought, aspiration, tradition, or religious
belief. The highest Thinkers, Artists, Poets,
Philosophers, and Mystics in those centuries
became Architects, and, in pure contemplation
of and love for the Divine, helped to beautify
design by giving up their lives and energies
to the work without reward. It was, in fact,
at that period the surest means by which
they could record their ideals and aspirations.
Before the advent of the printing press, with
its facilities for spreading knowledge broadcast,
they appreciated that Tectonic Art and
Iconography were the means by which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
could best permanently record and teach their
aspirations to the masses. Every beautiful
thought found its expression in some symbol
of artistic design. Each Cathedral was, in fact,
a beautiful complete <i>story</i>, and, when this has
been fully grasped, the enchantment of the
whole, the thread of gold running through
the whole of that wonderful pile, is what may
be called the Glamour of Symbolism.</p>

<p>For the last 400 years, Arch&aelig;ologists, Architects,
and others interested in the history of
Tectonic art, have been trying without avail
to discover what is called "the lost secret of
Gothic Architecture"; even Sir Christopher
Wren had a try and expressed his opinion
that it was lost for ever. They were all looking
in the wrong direction, confining themselves
to the mists of physical intellectual
perception, and could not get beyond that
limited range of thought. I propose now, in
illustration of this View, to show what this
secret was. It has the making of a fascinating
Romance; it is the most wonderful example
of what I will call "the Evolution of Thought
as depicted by Human strivings after the
Transcendental in Medi&aelig;val Mysticism." I
shall give it in a brief form, touching only on
those essential points which require a very
slight knowledge of Geometry, but those
interested in the subject may refer to <i>Ars
Quatuor Coronatorum</i> (vol. xxiii., 1910), where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
I have given the whole subject, <i>in extenso</i>,
under the title "Magister Mathesios."</p>

<p>To understand the subject it is necessary
to recognise fully the place Geometry held, not
only among Medi&aelig;val Builders, but also in
Classical times; it was recognised in those
early times as the head of all the Sciences,
and was the A, B, C of Hellenic Philosophy.
Come back with me 2300 years, to the time
when the "Greek Age of Reason" was at its
zenith, and Plato, the greatest of the philosophers,
was teaching at Athens, working
thus, let it be known to his honour, solely
for the love he bore to science, for he always
taught gratuitously. What qualification was
required of those who attended his Academy?
Look up over the porch, and you will see written
in large capitals these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&#924;&#919;&#916;&#917;&#921;&#931; &#913;&#915;&#917;&#937;&#924;&#917;&#932;&#929;&#919;&#932;&#927;&#931; &#917;&#921;&#931;&#921;&#932;&#937; &#924;&#927;&#933; &#932;&#919;&#925; &#931;&#932;&#917;&#915;&#919;&#925;.
</p>

<p>"Let no one who is ignorant of Geometry
enter my doors."</p></div>

<p>At the root of Socratic teaching was the
idea that wisdom is the attribute of the Godhead,
and Plato, for twenty years the companion
and most favoured pupil of Socrates,
was imbued with that doctrine, and, having
arrived at the conclusion that the impulse
to find out <span class="smcap">truth</span> was the necessity of intellectual
man, he saw in Geometry the keystone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of all Knowledge, because, among all
other channels of thought, it alone was the
exponent of absolute and undeniable truth.
He tells us that "Geometry rightly treated
is the Knowledge of the Eternal"; and
Plutarch gives us yet another instance of
Plato's teaching concerning this subject, in
which he looks upon God as the Great Architect,
when he says, "Plato says that God is
always geometrising." Holding, therefore, as
Plato did, that God was a great Geometer,
and that the aim of philosophy was the acquisition
of a knowledge of the Eternal, it
is natural that he should make a knowledge
of Geometry imperative on those wishing to
study philosophy. This was continued also
by those philosophers who succeeded Plato
in the management of the Academy, as we
are told that Zenocrates turned away an
applicant for admission, who knew no geometry,
with the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#959;&#965;, &#955;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#962; &#947;&#945;&#961; &#959;&#965;&#954; &#949;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#951;&#962; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#945;&#962;.
</p>

<p>"Depart, for thou hast not the <i>grip</i> of
philosophy."</p></div>

<p>In connection with the idea that God was
a Geometer, must be taken the contention
held by the Egyptians, and after them the
Greeks and Arabs, that the Right-Angled
Triangle symbolised the nature of the Universe;
it was called the law of the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
squares, because in every Right-Angled Triangle,
as expounded by the Pythagorean
Theorem, the squares, formed on the two
sides containing the Right Angle, must together
be exactly equal to the square on
the third side, whatever the shape of the
triangle may be. The Right Angle at an
early date gave its name to the odd numbers,
which were called, by the Greeks, gnomonic
numbers, as personifying the male
sex, and the Right-Angled Triangle was also
called the Nuptial Figure, or Marriage, the
Pythagorean Theorem receiving the name,
&#964;&#959; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;
&#964;&#951;&#962; &#957;&#965;&#956;&#966;&#951;&#962;
(the Theorem of the Bride).
Plutarch, in his <i>Osiris and Isis</i>, tells us in
explanation of this, "The Egyptians imagined
the nature of the Universe like this most
beautiful triangle, as Plato also seems to
have done in his work on the <i>State</i>, when
he sketches the picture of Matrimony under
the form of a Right-Angled Triangle. That
triangle contains one of the perpendiculars
of three, the base of four, and the hypotenuse
of five parts, the square of which is equal to
the squares of those sides containing the right
angle. The perpendicular (three) is the Male,
Osiris, the originating principle (&#945;&#961;&#967;&#7969;); the base
(four) is the Female, Isis, the receptive principle
(&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#951;); and the Hypotenuse (five) is
the offspring of both, Horus, the product
(&#945;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#7953;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#945;)." The central feature of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
triangle, upon which its property is based, is
the Right Angle. The Greeks gave to this
Right Angle the name of <i>Gnomon</i> (meaning
Knowledge), and it has ever since been, under
the form of a carpenter's "square," the emblem
or symbol of an Architect, the Master Mason,
as personifying the Great Architect of the
Universe&mdash;namely, He who has the knowledge
of Geometry; and, as the Right-Angled
Triangle represented the Universe, it was
upon the <i>perfection</i> of this Gnomon, or knowledge,
that the very existence of the Universe
depended, because the law of the three
squares only holds good when that angle is
perfect.</p>

<p>The Secret handed down in the Craft,
from Architect to Architect, was how to
form a perfect right angle, or, as it was
called, the "Square," without possibility of
Error, and this I have called "the Knowledge
of the Square." Vitruvius, who, at the
beginning of our Era, wrote his thesis on
Tectonic art, which is still the text-book of
Architecture for Ancient buildings, says Pythagoras
taught his followers to form a gnomon,
or square, as follows: "Take three rods, of
three lengths, four lengths, and five lengths
long; with these form a triangle, and, if each
rod be squared, you have 9, 16, and 25, and
the areas of the two former will be equal to
the latter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Now let us come to the closing years of
the tenth century. What a strange condition
of the building craft was to be seen all over
Europe; not a church was being built, nor
had been built, for the last twenty years; the
thousand years after Christ was drawing to
its close, everybody was waiting for, and expecting,
the world to come to an end; no new
undertakings were begun. How much money
went into the hands of the Monasteries and
other Religious Houses, as peace offerings for
the future welfare of the givers, nobody can
say; it was probably enormous. When, however,
the eleventh century was well started
and the crisis was over, churches were built
on a large scale, as shown by the numerous
remains we have of Norman buildings of the
last half eleventh century, and building was
probably at its height about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1140 to 1150;
but at this period an extraordinary thing
happened. Hitherto the arches in the Norman
style were round-headed and their columns
enormously thick to carry them; but suddenly
the style changed into the beautiful
Gothic all over Europe. No single country
can claim precedence, it was almost simultaneous;
churches half finished in the round
style were not only completed in the pointed,
but had parts already built altered to the new
style. What, then, determined this sudden
change, resulting in a wonderful accession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
beauty to Architectural design? We must
go to the Monasteries and Religious Houses
to find the explanation. These Houses had
become the Patrons of Masonry, the providers
of the funds for building Cathedrals, &amp;c.; it
naturally followed that, growing up alongside
the Operative Science, there was a Religious
symbolism being gradually formed which
attached itself specially to the tools used by
Masons, and thus formed the basis of Moral
teaching&mdash;"to act on the Square," "to keep
within the bounds of the Compasses," "to
be Level in all your dealings," &amp;c., &amp;c. A
wonderful, new, and Mystical form of Symbolism
was opened to them with the advent
of Geometry. The text-book of Geometry was
unknown throughout the whole of Europe,
omitting Spain, from the sixth to the beginning
of the twelfth century; it was, as I have
pointed out, well known in Greece before our
Era, and continued to be so up to about the
sixth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> In the fourth century lived
the Greek, Theon of Alexandria, so well known
for his edition of Euclid's Elements, with notes,
from which all Greek MSS. which first came
to light in the sixteenth century were taken,
being entitled &#949;&#954; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#920;&#949;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#969;&#957;, "from
Theon's Lectures," and which he probably used
as a text-book in his classes; but these MSS. had
all been lost before the seventh century, and
were not recovered again until the sixteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
century, when Simon Gryn&aelig;us, the greatest
Greek scholar on the Continent, and companion
of Melancthon and Luther, discovered
a copy in Constantinople. Meanwhile, Theon's
edition had been translated into Arabic, and
thus preserved by the Mohammedans, and it
was only at the beginning of the twelfth century
that Athelard of Bath, who had been
travelling in the East, came to study at Cordova,
in Spain, and there found the Arabic
MSS. of Euclid; these he translated into Latin,
and this translation must have come into the
hands of the patrons of the building craft at
the very time when the Gothic style had its
origin; it was the only Latin translation known
in Europe, and was, some centuries later, the
text-book of the first printed edition of Euclid.</p>

<p>The Operative Masons had always formed
their Right-Angled Triangles by means of
mundane measures of 3, 4, and 5 units to each
side respectively, as was done by the Harpedonapt&aelig;
of Egypt 5000 years ago, and 2500
years later by Pythagoras, and this same
method continues to be used to this day; but
to those of a religious turn of mind, who had
only lately become conversant with Euclid,
and looked upon Geometry not only as the
height of all learning, but, as they progressed
in the knowledge of its bearing on the Science
of building, actually made it synonymous
with Tectonic Art (the old MSS. which have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
come down to us from that time <i>invariably</i>
state that "at the head of all the Sciences
stands <i>Geometry which is Masonry</i>"), there
must have come a wave of wonderful enthusiasm
when they first discovered that
the Geometrical way of creating a Right
Angle, as given in Euclid I. ii., was by means
of an Equilateral Triangle, by joining the
Apex with the centre of the base. This
Equilateral Triangle was the earliest symbol
we know of the Divine <i>Logos</i> in connection
with that wonderful figure the Vesica Piscis;
and as the Bible declared that the Universe
was created by the Logos (the Word), so the
Square which represented the Universe was
naturally created by means of the Equilateral
Triangle. A great mystery this must
have appeared to those who, like the Hellenic
philosophers, postulated that everything on
Earth has its counterpart in Heaven, and
who, in their religious mysticism, were always
looking for signs of the transcendental in their
temporal surroundings.</p>

<p>But in what awe and reverence must they
have held Geometry, when they further found
that the Equilateral Triangle, representing
the Logos, was itself generated, as shown
in the <i>first</i> Problem of Euclid, upon which
the whole Science of Geometry was therefore
based, by the intersection of two Circles!
These two Circles were held by the Greeks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
at the beginning of our Era, to represent the
Past and Future Eternities generating the
Logos; but the whole figure (Euclid I. i.) was
at the time we are now dealing with looked
upon by Medi&aelig;val Architects as representing
the Three Divine <i>person&aelig;</i>, and that part, or
<i>cavity</i>, of the figure which is bounded by the
Arcs of the two circles, and which takes to
itself one-third of each of the two generating
circles (making its perifera exactly equal with
that remaining to each of the two circles, all
three therefore being <i>co-equal</i>), and in which
the Equilateral Triangle is formed (<i>vide</i> frontispiece),
was naturally held by the Medi&aelig;val
Architects, and indeed from earliest times, as
the most sacred Christian Emblem&mdash;namely,
that of <i>Regeneration</i> or "New Birth."</p>

<p>The Cavity is evidently referred to in the
Mystical Gospel of St. John (iii. 16), in the
question by and answer to Nicodemus, and it
was the eye of the needle referred to in St.
Mark x. 25, in answer to the question in verse
17, and again in St. Luke xviii. 25. In later
ages this symbol was extensively used by the
Christian Church to surround the "Soul of
a Saint" after death (illustrated in <i>Magister
Mathesios</i>). The date of the birth of a Saint
was always given as the date on which he or
she died and had been born again in the
Spiritual Life, and the Saint was depicted in
a Vesica Piscis, the vulva of the <i>Ruach</i> or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Holy Spirit, representing this new birth. To
show the extraordinary reverence and high
value attached to this symbol, it is only necessary
to remember that, from the fourth century,
when Theon of Alexandria lectured on
Geometry, and onwards, all Seals of Colleges,
Abbeys, Monasteries, and other religious communities,
as well as of ecclesiastical persons,
have been made invariably of this form, and
they continue to be made so to this day. It
was also in allusion to this most sacred ancient
emblem that Tertullian, and other early
Fathers, spoke of Christians as "Pisciculi."
It was called the "Vesica Piscis" (Fish's
Bladder), and named, no doubt, by the Greeks
at the beginning of our Era, for the purpose
of misleading the ignorant from the true
meaning of the Figure.</p>

<p>One can well understand the object which
led the learned Rabbi Maimonides, the greatest
savant of the Middle Ages, when addressing
his pupils in the twelfth century, to
command his hearers: "When you have discovered
the meaning thereof, do not divulge
it, because the people cannot philosophise nor
understand that to the Infinite there is no
such thing as Sex;" but later on the noted
writer on Symbolism, Durandus, in the introduction
to his book, is more explicit, and gives
the real meaning as follows: "The Mystical
Vesica Piscis ... wherein the Divinity and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
more rarely, the Blessed Virgin are represented,
has no reference, except in name, to
a fish, but represents the Almond, the symbol
of Virginity and self-production."</p>

<p>The Vesica Piscis, and its name, is intimately
connected with the discovery, by Augustus
C&aelig;sar in the century preceding our Era, as
narrated by Baronius, of a prophecy in one
of the Sibylline books, foretelling "a great
event coming to pass in the birth of One who
should prove to be the true 'King of Kings,'
and Augustus C&aelig;sar therefore dedicated an
altar in his palace to this unknown God."
Eusebius and St. Augustine inform us that
the first letter of each line of the verses from
the Erythrean Sibyl containing this prophecy,
formed the word &#921;&#935;&#920;&#933;&#931; (a fish), and were
taken as representing the sentence: &#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#965; &#933;&#7985;&#959;&#962; &#931;&#969;&#964;&#951;&#961; ("Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, the Saviour"). Based upon this
discovery arose that extraordinary enthusiasm,
during the second, third, and fourth
centuries, for hunting up further prophecies
in Pagan sources, resulting in a great
number of Sibylline verses being invented,
giving the minutest details in the Life of
our Lord. These fabrications seem to have
been at that time generally accepted by the
masses as true prophecies, though we know
now that they were written some centuries
after the events they were supposed to foretell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now return to the Vesica Piscis.
In the paintings and sculptures of the Middle
Ages, we find it constantly used to circumscribe
the figure of the Saviour, especially
whenever He is represented as judging the
world and in His glorified state. Many beautiful
examples of this in Anglo-Saxon work of
the tenth century may be seen in King Edgar's
Book of Grants to Winchester Cathedral and
the famous Breviary of St. Ethelwolfe. Numerous
illustrations of these and other pictures
of the Middle Ages, as also diagrams of the
properties of the Vesica Piscis, can be seen
in the volume I have already referred to dealing
fully with this subject.</p>

<p>The building fraternity was a purely Christian
community; the First Crusade raised
a great enthusiasm for building Christian
Churches, and brought in large gifts of money
for that purpose. Up to 1140 Norman Architecture
held sway, having the "Square" for
its unit, its greatest symbol being the <i>Gnomon</i>,
representing knowledge; but about that time,
as we have seen, arose from the study of Geometry,
the head of all learning, a Mystical
form having the mysterious figure of the
Vesica Piscis, the true Gothic Arch, with
the Equilateral Triangle enclosed as its unit,
and symbolising the Trinity in Unity. The
recognition of the import of the Trinity was
paramount throughout those early days; all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
important documents began with an Invocation
of the <i>Tres Person&aelig;</i>, or were garnished
with symbolic illustrations thereof; all the
old MSS., already referred to, which have
come down to us from that period, invariably
commence with "In the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost."</p>

<p>It can therefore be readily understood
what determined the sudden change between
1140-1150, resulting in that wonderful accession
of beauty to architectural design
which we find in the Gothic. The incentive
had to be a strong one, and of an eminently
religious character, to accomplish the
radical change of throwing over so absolutely
the Norman, and commencing to build entirely
on what are called Gothic lines. A
careful examination of the proportions of
the structures themselves, and the character
of the decorations found in the finest examples
of buildings representing that style,
at once shows us that the incentive was the
symbolism attached to the mysterious figure
called the Vesica Piscis, which appears to
be not only the principal feature upon which
the whole style rests, but is also employed,
as a symbol of the Divine, wherever we have
Gothic Architecture, either in painted windows
or mural decorations. Every Cathedral has its
Vesica Piscis, often of enormous dimensions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Geometry was synonymous with Masonry, and
the very <i>foundation</i> of the Science of Geometry,
as expounded by Euclid, was his <i>first</i>
proposition. <i>Every single problem</i> in the whole
of his books necessitates for its construction
the use of this one foundation&mdash;namely, "how
to form an Equilateral Triangle," and this is
the Mystical form of "the Knowledge of the
Square." This triangle, symbolising the Logos,
is therefore not only the <i>beginning</i> of the
Science of Geometry, and therefore of Masonry,
the Head of all the Sciences, but it is by that
triangle that all Geometrical forms, and therefore
forms of knowledge, are <i>made</i>, and it
became the most mysterious and secret symbol
of the Logos, for is it not written by St. John
that "In the beginning was the Logos, and
by it were all things made"; so the Vesica
Piscis, the cradle of the Logos, became the
great <i>secret</i> of Masonry, the foundation as
we find it upon which Gothic Architecture
was evolved, the means by which its wonderful
plans were laid down, and the most
reverenced figure in Religious Symbolism, as
shown by its use in seals, engravings, sculptures,
pictures, &amp;c., throughout the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>Let me make this clearer. The more one
examines the typical points in the Saxon,
Norman, and Gothic styles of Architecture, the
more clearly one sees that the Architects of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
two former used circles and squares on their
tracing-boards, as units for their proportions,
in drawing up both ground plans and elevations,
with here and there suggestions only
of the Equilateral Triangle having been made
use of in some of the smaller details; whereas
the Gothic Architects seem to have used the
Vesica Piscis almost entirely. This explains
the reason why true Gothic buildings have
always been said to be built mainly on the
basis of the Equilateral Triangle; this naturally
follows, because the use of the Vesica
creates, and therefore necessitates, the appearance
of the Equilateral Triangle in every conceivable
situation. The following quotation
is typical of the leading essay writers on this
subject: "The Equilateral Triangle enters
largely into, if it does not entirely control,
all medi&aelig;val proportions, particularly in the
ground plans. In Chartres Cathedral the
apices of two Equilateral Triangles (<i>vide</i>
frontispiece to these Views), whose common
base is the internal length of the transept,
measured through the two western piers of
the intersection, will give the interior length,
one apex extending to the east end of the
chevet within the aisles, the other to the
original termination of the Nave westward,
and the present extent of the side aisles in
that direction. With slight deviation, most,
if not all, the ground plans of the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Cathedrals are measurable in this manner,
and their choirs may be so measured almost
without exception. Troyes Cathedral is in
exact proportion with that of Chartres, and
the choirs of Rheims, Beauvais, St. Ouen at
Rouen, and others are equally so. Bourges
Cathedral, which has no transept, is exactly
three Equilateral Triangles in length inside,
from the East end of the outer aisle to the
Eastern columns supporting the West Towers.
Most English Cathedrals appear to have been
constructed in their original plans upon similar
rules." White's Classical Essay on Architecture
compares the Norman with the Gothic,
where he says: "In what is usually called the
Norman period, the general proportions and
outlines of the Churches are reducible to certain
rules of setting out by the plain Square.
As Architecture progressed the Square gradually
disappeared, and the proportion of general
outline, as well as of detail, fell in more and
more with applications of the Equilateral
Triangle, till the art, having arrived at its
culminating point, or that which is generally
acknowledged to be its period of greatest
beauty and perfection in the thirteenth and
the beginning of the fourteenth centuries,
again began to decline. With this decline the
Equilateral Triangle was almost lost sight
of, and then a mode of setting out work by
diagonal squares was taken up, for such is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
basis found exactly applicable to the work
of the fifteenth century, since which time
mathematical proportions have been generally
employed." And after referring to numerous
scale drawings of Churches, windows,
doors, and arches, he points out that every
student of Church architecture must pronounce
those of the untraceried and traceried
first point to be the most beautiful of all,
those of the Norman to be a degree less so,
and those of the perpendicular and debased
to be far inferior to either, and in that analysis
we find that the Equilateral Triangle was
used almost exclusively for determining one
order (the Gothic), the Square for another
(the Norman), and the Square diagonally
divided for the other (the debased).</p>

<p>Now let me try to describe the wonderful
properties of the Vesica Piscis, so that you
may understand the mystery which shrouded
it in the minds of those Medi&aelig;val builders.
The rectangle formed by the length and
breadth of this figure, in the simplest form,
has several extraordinary properties; it may
be cut into three equal parts by straight
lines parallel to the shorter side, and these
parts will all be precisely and geometrically
similar to each other and to the whole figure,&mdash;strangely
applicable to the symbolism attached
at that time to the Trinity in Unity,&mdash;and
the subdivision may be proceeded with indefinitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
without making any change in form.
However often the operation is performed,
the parts remain identical with the original
figure, having all its extraordinary properties,
the Equilateral Triangle appearing everywhere,
whereas no other rectangle can have
this curious property.</p>

<p>It may also be cut into four equal parts
by straight lines parallel to its sides, and
again each of these parts will be true
Vesicas, exactly similar to each other, and
to the whole, and of course the Equilateral
Triangle is again everywhere.</p>

<p>Again, if two out of the tri-subdivisions
mentioned above be taken, the form of these together
is exactly similar, geometrically, to half
the original figure, and again the Equilateral
Triangle is ubiquitous on every base line.</p>

<p>Again, the diagonal of the rectangle is
exactly double the length of its shorter side,
which characteristic is absolutely <i>unique</i>,
and greatly increases its usefulness for plotting
out designs; and this property of course
holds good for all the rectangles formed by
the original figure and for the other species
of subdivision. But perhaps its most mysterious
property (though not of any practical
use) to those who had studied Geometry, and
to whom this figure was the symbol of the
Divine Trinity in Unity, so dear to them,
was the fact that it actually put into their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hands the means of <i>trisecting</i> the Right
Angle.</p>

<p>Now, the three great problems of antiquity
which engaged the attention and wonderment
of geometricians throughout the Middle
Ages, were "the Squaring of the Circle,"
"the Duplication of the Cube," and lastly,
"the Trisection of an Angle," even Euclid
being unable to show how to do it; and yet
it will be seen that the diagonal of one of
the subsidiary figures in the tri-subdivision,
together with the diagonal of the whole
figure, actually trisect the angle at the
corner of the rectangle. It is true that it
only showed them how to trisect one kind of
angle, but it was that particular angle which
was so dear to them as symbolising their
craft, and which was created by the Equilateral
Triangle. All these unique properties
place the figure far above that of a square
for practical work, because even when the
diagonal of a square is given, it is impossible
to find the exact length of any of its sides or
<i>vice versa</i>; whereas in the Vesica rectangle
the diagonal is exactly double its shorter
side, and upon any length of line which may
be taken on the tracing-board as a base
for elevation, an Equilateral Triangle will be
found whose sides are of course all equal
and therefore known, as they are equal to
the base, and whose line joining apex to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
centre of base is a true Plumb line, forming
at its foot the perfect right angle, so important
in the laying of every stone of a building.</p>

<p>In the volume referred to I have given a
skeleton plan upon such a scale of subdivision
that a tracing-board, of 5 feet by 8 feet, would
be divided up into over one million parts, and,
as all these subdivisions are perfect representations
of the original Vesica figure with all its
properties, the design of the largest building,
with the minutest detail, could be drafted
with absolute accuracy. There are many
other curious properties of this Figure, but
they are difficult to explain without diagrams.
I will, however, give one more example of its
creative power. The problem of describing a
Pentagon must have puzzled architects considerably
in those early times, but this was
again easily accomplished by means of the
Vesica. Albrecht D&uuml;rer, the great designer
and engraver, who lived at the end of the
fifteenth century, refers to the Vesica in his
works (<i>Dureri Institutune Geometricarum</i>, lib.
ii. p. 56) in a way which shows that it was as
commonly known in his time as the Circle,
Square, and Triangle. His instructions for
forming a Pentagon are: "Designa circino
invariato tres piscium vesicas" (describe with
unchanged compasses three vesic&aelig; piscium).
Three similar circles are described with
centres at the angles of an Equilateral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Triangle, forming the three Vesic&aelig;, by means
of which the Pentagon is drawn, and from
which also we get a beautiful form of arch
very common in the thirteenth century
(<i>vide</i> illustrations in <i>Magister Mathesios</i>).
This is also the method used in that old
manuscript of the fifteenth century named
"Geometria deutsch." In this old MS. it is
also shown that the easiest method for finding
the centre of a circle, however large, or any
segment of a circle, is by means of the Vesica
Piscis. And just as we see so many Cathedrals
of the Middle Ages are stated by antiquarians
to have been planned on the Equilateral
Triangle, so do we find the Pentagon appearing
as the basis of Architectural designs of
buildings of a later date, such as Liverpool
Castle, Chester Castle, and other similar
structures; but the true means by which
each were laid down, as in the case of the
Equilateral Triangle, was again the Vesica
Piscis. A beautiful example of decoration,
on the basis of the Vesica, is seen in the
tomb of Edward the Confessor in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>I will conclude this subject by quoting from
the summing up by Prof. Kerrich (Principal
Librarian to the University of Cambridge in
1820), in his masterly Essay on Architecture,
where he gives the different forms of what
he calls the "Mysterious Figure," used in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
most noted Gothic buildings: he says, "I
would in nowise indulge in conjectures as
to the reference these figures might possibly
have to the most sacred mysteries of religion;
independently of any such allusion, their properties
are of themselves sufficiently extraordinary
to have struck all who have observed
them."</p>

<p>From earliest Christian times the principal
<i>doctrine</i> based upon the Mysticism of the
Neo-platonists and the Kabalists was what
was called the &#915;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;, the Knowledge of the
All, and the fundamental basis of this, as of
all esoteric teaching from the beginning of
History, was <i>Procreation</i>. From the first
dawn of civilisation the "Great One" always
had an enemy with whom he had to fight;
having conquered, he married that enemy,
and their offspring was Life or Duration. In
the oldest forms, as in Persia and ancient
Egypt, it was Light and Darkness, "Ormuz
and Ahriman," "Osiris and Isis," the Light conquering
Darkness, the Day conquering Night,
resulting in Time and duration. In the Eleusinian
Mysteries it was the "Sun and Earth"
producing Vegetable Life, and in the &#915;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962; it
was the "Ainsoph and Ignorance," resulting
in True Knowledge or Everlasting Life.</p>

<p>In the Vesica Piscis (<i>vide</i> frontispiece) we
see two Equilateral Triangles formed on the
same base, similar to what we found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
ground-plan of Chartres and other Gothic
Cathedrals; these two triangles symbolised to
the Medi&aelig;val Builders the Divine and Human
Natures of the Logos, the Word, the Creator;
they are both procreated and enclosed in the
Vesica; the one having the Apex pointed upwards,
represented Divine or Spiritual Life,
and in that I have placed the "Tetragrammaton,"
the Word or name of God (Jehovah),
which, throughout the Jewish race for
thousands of years, was held to be so sacred
that they did not dare to utter it aloud. It
was, at this time, depicted in the Equilateral
Triangle, the symbol of the Logos, becoming
thus the Masonic Word of the Middle Ages,
and was probably used, exoterically, for
purposes of recognition among members of
the Great Building Societies, with the introduction
of Gothic Architecture; but the
<i>esoteric</i> teaching, which was known only to
the &eacute;lite of the Craft and not by the Ordinary
Operatives, was the mystical <i>procreation</i> of
that triangle, the doctrine of Spiritual or
New Birth, symbolised by that mysterious
figure which we have seen was the very
foundation stone of Geometry, and therefore
of Tectonic Art, the Head of all learning,
and the great Secret of Gothic Architecture,
called for esoteric purposes "Vesica Piscis."
The Triangle, having the Apex pointing downwards,
represented Human or Physical Life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and I have placed therein a representation
of <i>sacrificial</i> death, which we shall see was
introduced, as a necessity, for the good of
the Race.</p>

<p>As "everything in Heaven has its counterpart
on Earth," so may we see, by introspection,
that the <i>reflecting</i> surface, the thin,
physical film between the Human and Divine,
is represented by that Base, and Human Life
then becomes truly, as it should be, the reflection
of the Divine.</p>

<p>One more glance through the Window at
what I will call&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"The Mystery of the Apex."<br />
</p>

<p>The earliest forms of Life, the unicellular
"Beings," whether animal or vegetable&mdash;for
both divisions, if they can be said to be divided,
have the same protoplasmic cell as basis of
life&mdash;were, and are still, immortal except for
accidents; they are not subject to natural
death as we know it; they multiply by fission
and not by "budding." It was only with the
building up of cell upon cell into communities,
and the advent of polycellular beings
of greater and greater complexity of structure,
that the "Wisdom" behind natural laws
introduced death as an <i>adaptation</i>, to prevent
monstrosities in the shape of mutilated specimens
being perpetuated on the earth. Life is
purely physical and, in conformity with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
modes under which our physical senses act,
has the appearance of tri-unity. As white
light is seen to be composed of but three
primary colours, as Music is based on the
Triad, as Space is known to us in three
dimensions only, and Geometry, "the Head
of all Learning," is based upon the Circle,
Square, and Triangle, so may we see life
in its three primary aspects: the Animal,
Vegetable, and Material. The last-mentioned
aspect, though long suspected, from the investigation
of Crystallography, to have in
some mysterious way a common basis with
the animal and vegetable, was not fully
grasped until, in the last few years, we have
been able to study in our laboratories the
actual evolution, or more correctly devolution,
of matter from one form to another;
and as all plants and animals are found to
be built up of the same identical protoplasmic
cells, so are we now able to break
down and analyse not only these cells but
even the very structure of matter, and
find that all substances are built up of exactly
the same bricks, the different forms
known to us as Elements being the <i>designs</i>
of the great Architect upon which each
structure has been built; and these completed
designs again are used and become
the "ashlars" of the higher forms of plant
and animal structure. As Evolution in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms has given us
Species, so in the Material it has developed
Elements. The structures of animal and vegetable
life are of comparatively recent formation,
and are still apparently progressing in
the direction of complexity, whereas the structures
of matter appear to have long passed
the stage of highest complexity, and the
elements are now undergoing the retrograde
process of being transformed, by radio-activity,
from the more complex into simpler
elements of lower atomic denominations&mdash;namely,
having fewer bricks in each atom.</p>

<p>All these material designs are more or less
radio-active&mdash;namely, changing into other elements,
but some, like radium, polonium, &amp;c.,
are active to an extraordinary extent. Each
molecule or atom may be looked upon as an
<i>aperture</i>, more or less open, through which
we have flowing the equivalent of what may
be called a leak from the Infinite, the changing
of one element into another being represented
by the change of shape or activity of that
aperture. Countless ages ago these apertures
were, by evolution, growing more and more
complex in shape, but when the limit of complexity
was reached and the <i>Apex</i> was passed,
an adaptation, somewhat analogous to death
in the animal and vegetable, must have come
into play, with the result that these apertures
are now becoming more and more simple in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
their shape and activity. The Infinite referred
to above may be diagnosed by some as being
in the fourth dimension of space, or it may
even be comprised within the Ether of our
known three dimensions, for the discovery
of radio-activity has enabled us to see that
Ether is not only as dense as iron, but
millions of times denser than that metal,
every cubic foot, or probably cubic inch,
being capable of supplying millions of horse-power
if it could only be tapped. A homely
simile of this leak from the Infinite may be
seen in a glass of aerated water, where an
irregularity of surface, a crumb of bread, or
a grain of sand becomes the means by which
carbonic-dioxide escapes from the interstices
of the water.</p>

<p>Radio-active substances then are really
forges for forming new structures of matter
or forms of energy, rather than quarries from
which they are cut, and we seem to get a
glimpse of the origin of life, perhaps itself
the cause of "retrogression" in the material,
coming through from the Reality, the Infinite
beyond the physical Universe.</p>

<p>Life and its processes are well symbolised by
a triangle, the base of which is the "Divide"
between the Real and its reflections or shadows
on the Material plane, and through which all
energy percolates. One side of the triangle
represents anabolism, or the process of building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
up, and the other katabolism, the process
of breaking down, and at the Apex is
the Mystical "Terror of the Threshold," the
"Ainsoph" (<i>vide</i> frontispiece), which introduced
<i>sacrificial</i> death to the Physical, as an
adaptation in the evolution of, and for the
good of, the Human race. With the death
of the Physical, the rending of the Veil, as
we have seen in View Two, all Shadows and
Reflections disappear, and, in place of "seeing
as through a glass darkly," the Soul has its
true birth, and at last enters upon its heritage
in the Divine Life, face to face with
the Reality, the Good, the Beautiful, and the
True.</p>

<h3><a name="VIEW_FOUR" id="VIEW_FOUR"></a>VIEW FOUR</h3>

<h2>LOVE IN ACTION</h2>


<p>In the preceding Views we have seen that
Time and Space have no real existence
apart from our physical senses; they are only
modes or conditions under which those senses
act, and by which we gain a very limited and
illusory knowledge of our surroundings. Our
very consciousness of living depends upon
our perception of multitudinous changes in
our surroundings, and our very thoughts are
therefore also limited by Time and Space,
because <i>change</i> is dependent on those two
limits, the very basis of perceived motion
being the time that an object takes to go
over a certain space; we must therefore look
behind consciousness itself, beyond the conditioning
in Time and Space, for the true
reality of Being. We have seen that man is
the offspring of two distinct natures&mdash;the
Spiritual or Transcendental and the Material
or Physical; the former is the Real, the
latter is only a shadow. If we now try
to consider the connection between these
two natures, we have to recognise that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
with all our advance in Knowledge during
the last hundred years, we are indeed still as
children playing with pebbles on the sea-shore,
knowing neither why we are placed
there, nor what those pebbles are, or whence
they came. Though we seem ever to be
discovering fresh truths concerning their
relations one with another, when arranged
in different patterns, built up into new forms,
or split up into smaller fragments, we have
to acknowledge (substituting thoughts for
pebbles) that we are still only learning our
alphabet and the simple rules of multiplication,
addition, and division, which must be
mastered before we can hope to take the real
step towards understanding.</p>

<p>We are surrounded by mysteries; we are
indeed a mystery to ourselves, we do not
even know how the Physical Ego is connected
with the physical world; how the
sense organs, receiving the impression of
multitudinous and diverse frequencies of
different intensities, transmit them to the
brain, and how the mind is able to combine
all these impressions and form concepts. But
by examining the Physical Universe, we seem
to see clearly that the only Reality is the
Spiritual, the Here, and the Now, that our
real <i>Personality</i> being Spiritual is independent
of Space and Time limitations, and is therefore
Omnipresent and Omniscient; it may indeed be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
not only connected with the Physical Ego of
this World, but be in close working connection
with other Physical Egos in the Universe, and
may, in some wonderful process, through its
affinity with the Great Spirit, be helping
them to progress in other directions possibly
quite beyond our power to conceive under
the conditions we are accustomed to here.</p>

<p>A great forest tree forms each year a
multitude of separate buds; each of these
buds is an independent plant which has only
a temporary existence and has no present
knowledge of the other buds, but it is by
means of all these buds and the leaves they
develop, that the tree is nourished and increases
from year to year. Still more wonderful
is the fact that it is these temporary
existences which, in accordance with the
general law of life-production, form special
"ovules," which we call seeds, each of which
has the potentiality for growing up into a
great forest tree, which, in its turn, is capable
of pushing forth temporary existences in
countless directions. We have, in the above
process of creating a forest tree, a likeness
on the Physical Plane to what I would suggest
is the process not only of the creation of
the Race, but, on the Transcendental Plane,
the multiplication of permanent personalities
by means of, or in connection with, the temporary
and Space-limited Human Physical Ego.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, as the human mind forms a thought,
clothes it in physical language, and sends it
forth in such a form as not only affects our
material sense of hearing, but conveys to the
hearer the very thought itself, so the whole
Physical Universe is a temporary and Space-limited
representation of the Reality which is
behind, is in fact the materialisation of the
Will or Thought of the Great Spirit. The
"taking root" or advent of the Spiritual to
the genus homo, made it possible for man
to interpret the Good, Beautiful, and True
in the phenomena of nature, and, as we, by
studying these materialisations, gain knowledge
of the Reality, and our personalities
become real powers, so may we at length
approach the point where we may feel that
we are thinking, or having divulged to us,
the very thoughts of God; and, though it
may never be possible in this life to form
a full conception of the Reality, we may, I
think, even with our present state of knowledge,
aspire to understand the messages
conveyed to us in some of the multitudinous
forms, under which these thoughts are presented
to us, and I propose giving an example
of this later on in this View.</p>

<p>Once more, in the case of a picture, it is
possible, by examining and comparing a
number of certain short lines in perspective,
to discover not only the position occupied by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the Artist, but also the point to which all
those lines converge; so by examining and
combining certain lines of Thought on the
Physical Plane, and following them as far as
we can with our present knowledge towards
the point where our Ideals of the Good,
Beautiful, and True intersect, we may reach
the position from which we may be able to
form, although through a glass darkly, even
a conception of the Great Reality, and therefore
of Its Offspring the Transcendental Ego,
and its connection with the Universe.</p>

<p>As the whole of Nature is the temporary
and Space-limited manifestation of the
Reality, so the individual Physical Ego is the
manifestation in Time and Space of the
Transcendental Ego or true Personality. The
Physical Ego is its transient expression and
has no other use beyond this life. Each
Physical Ego helps, or should help forward,
the general improvement of the Race towards
perfection. Each generation should come
into being a step nearer to the Spiritual,
until it can be pictured that at the final
consummation, there will be nothing imperfect,
no shadow left; the full complement
of Spiritual Personalities being complete in
the Great All-Father.</p>

<p>Do we not then see clearly that the Physical
Ego, comprised in what we call "I am," "I perceive,"
"I think," "I conceive," "I remember,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
is transient, and has only to do with the
progress of the Race? It is the Shadow or
Image in the Physical Universe of that Personality
which Transcends Time and Space.
Take away a small portion of the Brain, the
organ of the Mind, and Memory is wiped out,
remove the greater part of it and the manifestation
of the Physical Ego is destroyed;
though the body is as much alive as before,
there is apparently nothing left but the
physical life, which it has in common with
all animals, plants, and probably, as strongly
suggested by late discoveries in Radio-activity,
even with what is called inorganic matter.
The Brain, and therefore the Ego, is not a
necessity for Physical life; this is clearly
seen in the lower forms of life&mdash;it would be
difficult to point out the brain of a Cabbage
or an Oak Tree.</p>

<p>In the last forty years we have entered
upon a new era of religion and philosophy;
we hear no more of the old belief that the
study of scientific facts leads to atheism or
irreligion; we begin to see that Religion and
Science must go hand in hand towards elucidating
the Riddle of the Universe, and such a
change enables us even to aspire to show, as
I now propose to do, that it is possible, by
examining certain phenomena in Nature, to
reach that point where we may feel that we
are listening to and understanding, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
through a glass darkly, what may be called
the very Thoughts of the Great Reality. I
will take for examination the subject most
intimately connected with the title of this
View&mdash;namely, the nature of the growth
of the Transcendental Personality, upon what
that growth depends, and how we may understand
that the attainment to Everlasting Life
is dependent upon that growth.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out in View Two
that the Transcendental Personality, being
Spiritual, and therefore akin to the Great
Reality, may be said to have no free-will of
itself. Its will or influence must always be
working towards perfection in the form "Let
Thy Will, which is also my will, be done";
the efficacy of its influence with the Great
Reality depends on its growth or nourishment
by the knowledge of the Good, Beautiful,
and True ever bringing it more and
more nearly into perfect touch or sympathy
with the All-loving. The power of
prayer therefore depends upon two conditions;
it must be in the form of "Let
thy Will be done," and that which prays
must be capable of making its petition felt,
by having already gained a knowledge of
what that Will is. I am, of course, not
referring to that form of prayer which,
alas with so many, seems to be the attempt
to get as much out of the Absolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
as is possible, with the least amount of
trouble.</p>

<p>If now we carefully examine the Phenomena
around us, we make the extraordinary
discovery that this power to influence is the
very basis of survival and of progress
throughout the universe. In the organic
world all Nature seems to be praying in one
form or another, and only those that pray
with efficacy, based upon the above two
conditions, survive in the struggle for existence.
The economy of Nature is founded
upon that inexorable law the "Survival of
the Fittest"; every organism that is not in
sympathy with its environment, and cannot
therefore derive help and nourishment from
its surroundings, perishes. Darwin tells us
that the colours of flowering plants have
been developed by the necessity of attracting
the bees, on whose visits depends the
power of plants to reproduce their species;
those families of plants which do not as it
were pray to the bees with efficacy, fail to
attract, are not therefore fertilised, and disappear
without leaving successors. Flowers
may also be said to be praying to us by
their beauty, or usefulness, and in some
cases, as with orchids, by their marvellous
shapes. We answer their prayer by building
hot houses and tending them with care,
because they please us, and therefore we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
help them to live; while, on the contrary,
those plants that have not developed these
qualities are not only neglected, but, in some
cases, as with weeds, we take special trouble
to exterminate them, because their existence
is distasteful to us.</p>

<p>Charles Darwin also tells us that Heredity
and Environment are the prime influences
under which the whole Organic World is sustained;
in other words, every organism has
implanted in it by heredity the principle of life,
but the conditions under which it will be possible
for that life to expand and come to perfection,
rest entirely upon its power to bring
itself into harmony with its environment.
This principle of life does not come naked into
the world, it is fortified by heredity, with
power gained by its parents in their struggle
for existence, and in their persistence to get
into sympathy with their environment. The
knowledge they gained, by this struggle,
they have handed down to their offspring,
and given it thereby the possibility of also
gaining for itself that knowledge of, and
power to get into sympathy with, its environment,
upon which its future existence
will depend. So may we not see that in the
Spiritual World, these two conditions dominate,
and that it is only by the clear comprehension
of their reality that we can
understand how all-important it is for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
soul to bring itself nearer and nearer into
harmony with its environment, the Spiritual,
and how the efficacy of prayer depends upon
the Knowledge of what is the Will of God?</p>

<p>We have received from our Spiritual Father
the principle of Everlasting Life, and the
aspirations which, if followed, will enable
that life to expand and come to perfection;
but, as in the case of physical organism, the
gift is useless unless we elect to use those
aspirations aright, and gain thereby a knowledge
of our Spiritual Environment, which
alone can bring us into sympathy with the
Great Reality. Without this "Knowledge of
God," we can see by analogy on the Organic
Plane that Everlasting Life is impossible&mdash;we
are as weeds and shall be rooted out. This
is no figment of the imagination, it seems
to be the only conclusion we can come to
if Nature is the work of Nature's God, and
Man is made in the image (spiritual) of that
God. Herbert Spencer came to the same
conclusion when defining everlasting existence.
He says: "Perfect correspondence
would be perfect life; were there no changes
in the environment but such as the organism
had adapted changes to meet, and were it
never to fail in the efficiency with which
it met them, there would be Eternal Existence
and Eternal Knowledge" (<i>Principles of
Biology</i>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The power of influence, by sympathetic
action, may also be seen in another direction;
consider the fact that if we are in a room
with a piano and we sing a certain note,
say E flat, we not only hear that note
coming back from the piano, but, if we
examine the strings, we find that all the
E flats are actually vibrating in sympathy,
because they are in perfect harmony with
the note given out by the voice; but none
of the other strings are responding because
they are out of harmony. With this simile
in mind, let us consider the curious fact that
a moth always lays its eggs on that particular
plant upon which the caterpillars,
when they hatch out of these eggs, must
feed. The study of the Life History of
Insects has always been of great interest to
me, as I firmly believe that we are on the
verge of a great discovery, and that the
first indications are being revealed to us
through the investigation of the Biology of
Insects. Some of you may, perhaps, have
watched this progress of ovipositing, as I
have done, and noticed how the female moth
will hover in a peculiar way over different
plants, but does not alight until she comes
to a plant near akin to the one she is
seeking. She then alights, but remains, on
tip-toe as it were, with legs outstretched
and wings quivering, and soon mounts again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
into the air; it is only when she alights on
the proper food plant that she shows unmistakably
that she knows her quest is
ended and her eggs are laid. This particular
plant has no other attractions for her, she
takes her food irrespectively from any other
flower which secretes honey, and yet, when
she is ready to fulfil her destiny, she is
unerringly drawn towards that particular
plant which must be the food of her offspring.
What is this wonderful sense? We call it
instinct, a name which is made to cover all
other senses in the lower animals, of which
we have no cognisance ourselves. Let us
take our own senses as a guide: we find
that they are all based on the appreciation
of frequencies, of greater or less rapidity, by
means of organs specially adapted to vibrate
in sympathy with those pulsations, and thus
we gain knowledge of external things. Two
tuning forks or two organ pipes when vibrating
close to each other, give out a pure
musical note when they are in perfect harmony,
and they then have, as it were, "rest"
together; but when one is put even slightly
out of harmony, there is, in place of a pure
musical note, a rise and fall of sound in heavy
throbs, strangely characteristic of "quarrelling";
in fact, discord and "unrest."</p>

<p>In our sense of hearing we can only appreciate
up to 40,000 vibrations in a second as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
a musical sound, whereas, with Light and
other electrical phenomena, as we shall see
in a later View, we can appreciate sympathetic
frequencies of not only many millions,
but indeed millions of millions in a second,
and yet it is possible that, in the sense (of
insects) we are now examining of life appreciating
life, we may be in the presence of
frequencies as far removed from light as
light is from sound. If, then, we may follow
the analogy from our highest senses, we seem
to get a clear explanation of the mystery of
insect discrimination. The insect, in her then
state, could have no pleasure in the presence
of certain plants, their modes of frequency
being out of sympathy with that particular
Insect Life, and, it may be conceived that,
not only is there no inducement for the
insect to alight on that plant, but that even
in its near proximity that insect would feel
discomfort or restlessness; when, however, a
plant is reached which is near akin to the
one required, less antipathy or unrest would
be felt, and, when the true species of plant
is reached, all would be harmony, pleasure,
and rest, the functions of Insect Life would
be vivified, and its life-work accomplished
under the influences of sympathetic action.</p>

<p>I have made several other investigations on
this subject, but I must only give one more to
illustrate the higher form of Animal Life appreciating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Animal Life. There is a large class of
insects, called Ichneumonid&aelig;, which lay their
eggs in the bodies of caterpillars, and, as in
the case of a moth laying its egg on the special
food plant upon which its caterpillar can feed,
so does each species of these insects unerringly
lay its eggs in the body of a particular kind
of caterpillar. It must be a wonderful sense
which can enable an Ichneumon Fly to do
this; it has never seen that caterpillar before,
as the egg, from which its own caterpillar
was hatched, was laid inside the body of one
of those caterpillars, and the caterpillar upon
which it fed had been eaten up and disappeared
at least six months before the
Ichneumon Fly had even made its way out
of its own cocoon; and yet this insect is not
only forced, by some mysterious power, to
lay its egg in the body of a caterpillar, but
there is only one species which will serve its
purpose, and it has to hunt up this particular
caterpillar from among thousands of other
different species.</p>

<p>Let me put before you what is, perhaps, the
most mysterious illustration which we have
under this heading, wherein the Ichneumon
Fly cannot even get sight of its prey, nor
employ any sense similar to our own for its
detection. There are several species of moths
whose caterpillars live in the very heart of
trees. We will take the case of the caterpillar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of Zeuzera Aesculi, the Leopard Moth; the egg
of this Moth is laid in a crevice of the bark,
and, when first hatched, the small larva penetrates
through the bark into the centre of an
apple, pear, or plum tree, and then commences
to eat its way upwards, forming at first a very
small tunnel, but gradually increasing it, as the
caterpillar grows larger, into a passage of about
half an inch in diameter. In such a position,
surrounded as it is by solid wood, the thickness
of which would probably not be less than
one and a half or two inches, we might suppose
that the caterpillar would be safe from
its enemies, but it is not: there is a large
Ichneumon Fly which cannot propagate its
species unless it can lay its eggs in the body
of this particular caterpillar. This Ichneumon
Fly can, from outside, not only tell that inside
the stem of that tree there is a caterpillar,
but can locate the exact spot, and, still more
wonderful, is able to determine whether or
not that caterpillar is the particular species
it is in search of. There are numerous other
species of moths whose caterpillars feed in
the centre of trees, and yet this female
Ichneumon is able to mark down as her prey,
although far out of reach of any sense known
to us, that one species which alone can serve
her purpose. As soon as she has located the
exact position of the caterpillar, she unsheathes
a long delicate ovipositor, with which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
she is provided, and drills it right through
the intervening solid wood until it pierces
the body of the caterpillar; she then lays an
egg down that long tube into its body and
repeats the process two or three times. The
caterpillar itself does not appear to feel any
inconvenience from this process and continues
to feed and grow larger; but it has the seeds
of death within itself, and the two or three
little caterpillars, which hatch out of the
eggs of the Ichneumon, are also growing
rapidly inside it. At last, when the time comes
that the large caterpillar should have been
full fed, and it has eaten its way outwards
until it rests close under the bark, preparatory
to turning into a chrysalis, its enemies
finish their destructive work, and, if the tree
is then opened, the empty skin and cartilage
skeleton of the large caterpillar is found,
together with two or three large cocoons.
These cocoons, if kept, will produce in due time
specimens of the Ichneumon Fly, and these will
in their turn go about their murderous work
as soon as their proper hunting season comes
round again.</p>

<p>This is only an isolated case out of thousands
of similar occurrences in every locality;
in fact, if you walk along any palings in the
country in the early summer, you will see
at every few steps the evidence of similar
tragedies. Those of you who live in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
country must often have seen on palings
little heaps containing a dozen or more of
the small yellow Microgaster Cocoons, and
if these are examined carefully they will be
found to be surrounding the skin of a caterpillar.
These minute cocoons may be kept
under a wine glass and, from each a minute
Ichneumon Fly, with (if a female) its sharp
ovipositor, will emerge in due time. It is
curious what mistakes can be made even by
intelligent persons. I have had the skin of
the caterpillar and this little heap of yellow
Microgaster Cocoons sent me to examine, and
have been seriously asked whether this was
not a true case of Parthenogenesis; the suggestion
being that the caterpillar had actually
laid eggs, instead of waiting until it had
become a moth, and that its efforts, to alter
the course of nature, had been too much for
its constitution and it had died in the act!
There are other illustrations I should have
liked to give but space will not permit, the
most remarkable being, perhaps, the knowledge
a Queen Bee possesses of the proximity
of another Queen, even when that other is
still in the pupa state, sealed up in a waxen
cell. I have made numerous experiments
with Queens of the common black English Bee
(<i>Apis mellifica</i>), and also the yellow-striped
Italian Bee (<i>Apis ligustica</i>), which belong
to the same order (<i>Hymenoptera</i>) as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Ichneumon Flies, and the same marvellous
sense of life appreciating life at a distance,
and through solid matter, is experienced.</p>

<p>If we now follow the same Thought by examining
the Inorganic, we make the extraordinary
discovery that this power to influence,
based on sympathetic action, is the very mainspring
by which physical work can be sustained,
and upon it depends entirely the very
action of our physical senses. Our senses are
based upon the appreciation of Vibration, in
the Air and Ether, of greater or less rapidity,
according to the presence in our organs of
processes capable of acting in sympathy with
those frequencies. The limits within which
our senses can thus be affected are very small;
the ear can only appreciate thirteen or fourteen
octaves in sound, and the eye less than
one octave in light; beyond these limits,
owing to the absence of processes which can
be affected sympathetically, all is silent and
dark to us. This capacity for responding to
vibration under sympathetic action is not
confined to Organic Senses; the physical
forces, and even inert matter, are also sensitive
to its influences, as I will now demonstrate
to you.</p>

<p>In wireless telegraphy it is absolutely
necessary that the transmitter of the electro-magnetic
waves should be brought into
perfect harmony with the receiver&mdash;without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
that condition it is impossible to communicate
at a distance; again, a heavy pendulum
or swing can, by a certain force, be pushed,
say an inch, from its position of rest, and
each successive push will augment the swing,
but only on one condition, namely, that
the force is applied in sympathy with the
pendulum's mode of swing; if the length of
the pendulum is 52 feet, the force must be
applied only at the end of each eight seconds,
as, although the pendulum at first is only
moving one inch, it will take four seconds to
traverse that one inch, the same as it would
take to traverse 10 feet or more, and will not
be back at the original position till the end of
eight seconds; if the force is applied before
that time the swing of the pendulum would
be hindered instead of augmented. Even a
steam engine must work under this influence
if it is to be effective; there may be enough
force in a boiler to do the work of a thousand
horse-power, but, unless the slide valve is arranged
so that the steam enters the cylinder
at exactly the right moment, namely, in
sympathy with the thrust of the piston, no
work is possible.</p>

<p>To understand the next example I want
you first to recognise that, apart from its
physical qualities, every material body has
certain, what may be called, traits of character,
which belong to it alone; there is generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
one special trait or "partial," namely, the
characteristic which it is easiest for the
particular body to manifest, but I shall show
you that by sympathetic action others can
be developed. I have several pieces of ordinary
wood, used for lighting fires, each of
which, according to its size and density, has its
special characteristic; if you examined each
by itself you would hardly see that they are
different from one another except slightly
in length, but if I throw them down on the
table, you would hear that each of them gives
out a clear characteristic note of the musical
scale: to carry this a step forward, I have a
long, heavy, iron bar, about 4 feet long and
2 inches thick, so rigid that no ordinary
manual force can move it out of the straight,
and, from mere handling, you would find it
difficult to imagine that it would be amenable
to soft influences. But I have studied this inert
mass, and, as each person has special characteristics,
some being more partial than others
to, say, Literary pursuits, Athletics, Music,
Poetry, Engineering, Science, or Metaphysics,
so I am able to show that this iron mass has
not only a number of these "partials," some
of which are extraordinarily beautiful and
powerful, audible over long distances, but
that by the lightest touch of certain small
generating rubbers, not more than an ounce
in weight and tipped with cork or leather,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
each of which has been put into perfect
sympathy with one of those traits, I can
make that mass demonstrate them both optically
and audibly; but, without those special
sympathetic touches, it is silent and remains
an inert mass. This result is obtained by
physical contact between the instrument
and the mass, but we will now carry this
another step forward and deal with the
subject of the action of Influence at a
distance, or what may be called Prayer, between
two of these rigid masses. From what
we have already seen, it is clear that the
Soul of man could not possibly pray with
efficacy to a graven image; there is nothing
in sympathy between them, and, without
sympathetic action, influence is impossible;
but it is quite possible for Matter to pray
with efficacy to Matter, provided the material
soul, if we may use the analogy, is brought
into perfect sympathy with the material god,
and I can now put before you an experiment
showing this taking place.</p>

<p>I have another heavy bar of iron, not so
long but of the same thickness as the one
already described, and have found its strongest
characteristic; I have another small rubber,
fashioned so that its characteristic is in
perfect sympathy with that of the bar,
namely, that the number of vibrations, in a
second, of the instrument are exactly equal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to those of the iron mass, and it is, therefore,
as we saw in the last experiment, able by
contact to influence the bar sympathetically.
The slightest touch throws the bar into such
violent vibration that a great volume of
sound is produced, which can be heard a
quarter of a mile away. The result of this
sympathetic touch is far from being transient,
in fact, the bar will continue to move, audibly,
for a long time. This movement in the mass
of iron was started by physical contact, but
having once started the bar praying, willing,
or thinking, whichever you like to call it,
that bar now has the power to affect, without
contact, another rigid bar of iron even when
removed to great distances, provided the
second bar possesses a similar characteristic,
and that that characteristic has been brought
into perfect <i>sympathy</i> with that of the first
bar. I have a second bar which fulfils these
conditions, and, although, at the outset, it
had no power whatever to respond, it has
been gradually, as it were, educated, namely,
brought nearer and nearer into sympathy
with the first bar, until it is now able to
respond across long distances; it has acted
across the whole length of one of the largest
halls in London so strongly that it could be
heard by all present. We will now reverse
the process of bringing these bars into sympathy,
and I will throw the first out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
harmony by slightly changing its characteristic;
the change is extremely small, quite
inappreciable to the human ear, the bar
giving out as full and pure a note as it did
before the alteration was made; in fact, the
change is so slight that it can still, with a
little force, be stimulated by the same generator,
and yet the whole power to influence
has been lost; the first bar, although it is
praying with great force, gets no response
from the second bar, and, even if the bars are
now brought on to the same table and put
within a few inches of each other, there is
still no reply, there is no sympathetic action,
the efficacy of prayer between the two has
been completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Do we not then see the principle upon
which the efficacy of Prayer depends, that the
whole object of a Human Soul, when using
the words "Thy Will be done," is to bring
itself closer and closer into perfect sympathy
with the Absolute? When that is accomplished,
we may understand, from our simile,
that not only shall we and our aspirations be
influenced by the Will of the Deity, but that
then our wishes, in their turn, must have
great power with God, and it becomes possible
for even "Mountains to be removed and cast
into the midst of the sea."</p>

<p>How truly the Philosopher Paul at the
beginning of our Era recognised that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
knowledge of God, which Christ Himself tells
us is Everlasting Life, may be gained by the
study of the material creation; His words
were sadly overlooked by many who, half a
century ago, were afraid that the discoveries
of Science were dangerous to belief in the
Divine. He says: the unrighteous shall be
without excuse because "The invisible things
of Him since the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being perceived through the
things that are made, even His everlasting
power and divinity" (Romans i. 18 to 20,
R.V.).</p>

<p>We have seen the truth of this wonderful
statement, we have traced the reflection of
the greatest attribute of the Deity, Divine
Love, on the material plane. What has been
the result of our investigation? We find
that throughout the whole of Nature the one
great universal power is Sympathy.</p>

<p>'Tis verily "love that makes the world go
round." What a marvellous conclusion to
our investigation! Let us see where it leads
us. The whole of creation is the materialisation
of the Thoughts of the Deity; we have,
therefore, in the forces of Nature, the impress
of the very Essence of God. Our Innermost
Self is an emanation from Him, and
Prayer, which, at the beginning, is only a
striving to bring ourselves into harmony
with the Deity, must, as the Soul grows in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
strength and knowledge, become a great
power working under the wonderful principle
of Sympathy. True prayer, indeed,
becomes "<i>Love in Action</i>," and, under certain
conditions, Prayer may actually be looked
upon as the greatest physical force in Nature.
But let us carry this one step further: can
we, by our analogy of Matter praying, understand
why "the knowledge of God is Everlasting
Life"? Look at the first iron bar,
and watch how, as long as it keeps on vibrating,
the second bar, <i>because it is in sympathy</i>,
will be kept in motion. If it were possible
for the first bar to vibrate for ever, the second
bar would, speaking materially, have everlasting
life, through its being in perfect sympathy
with the first bar; without this connection
the bar would be lifeless. Now apply
this to our Transcendental Personality; it is
being nourished, the knowledge of God is increasing,
it is at last pulsating in perfect harmony
with the Deity, and when, for it, the
Material Universe disappears, its <i>affinity</i> to
Infinite Love must give it Everlasting Life.
Everything that has not that connection is
but a shadow which will cease to be manifest
when the Great Thought is completed,
the volition of the Deity is withdrawn, and
the Physical Universe ceases to exist; nothing
can then exist except that which is perfected,
that which is of the essence of God&mdash;namely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the Spiritual. Perfect harmony will then
reign supreme, such happiness as cannot be
described in earthly language nor even imagined
by our corporeal senses; hence, in the
many passages referring to that wondrous
Life hereafter, we are not told what Heaven
is like but only what is not to be found
there:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Eye hath not seen nor ear heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neither have entered into the heart of man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The things that God hath prepared for them that love Him."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Cor.</span> ii. 9.<br /><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are several other phenomena which I
might have examined, but I chose this particular
aspect of the Reality, as best illustrating
the subject I am trying to elucidate
in these Views, though it was probably the
most difficult one to bring home to the general
reading public. There are, I know, from
personal knowledge, many of my readers
who will have been able to follow and appreciate
what I have attempted to demonstrate,
but to those who have not grasped
the connection between the Infinite and
Finite, the Transcendental and the Physical
Ego, the Real and its Shadow, a few more
words of explanation may be helpful.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the negatives, Cold,
Ignorance, Falsehood, Ugliness are manifestations
of their positives, as given in my list<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
in View One, and it is also not difficult to
show that Evil or Sin is dependent upon Good
in the same way as the Shadow depends upon
Light for its manifestation. Do not let me
be misunderstood; I have never suggested
that these negatives or negations have not
the appearance of realities to us, under our
present conditions of existence; they indeed
have to be dealt with by us as realities, but
they are only manifested as phenomena on
the physical plane, because our Senses, and
therefore Thoughts, are limited by Time and
Space and therefore dependent upon <i>relativity</i>.</p>

<p>Let me put the case of Good and Evil
before you, as analogous to, say, Light
and Shadow. Moral laws and responsibility
thereto are dependent upon the existence of
Goodness; the purely animal Homo was, as
I have pointed out, free from sin or responsibility
until the advent of the Spiritual made
manifest, in that animal, the physical Ego
and raised him far above all other animals.
Man thus became a responsible moral being,
a living soul, aware of Right, and therefore
of Wrong, and certain acts then became for
him sin that were not sin before. Thus the
advent of Christ, and, in a less degree, the
coming into the world of every good man, so
raised, and is raising, the level of moral rectitude
that things become sin that were not sin
before; St. Paul himself specially recognises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
this when he says that without law there is
no sin. The Goodness, then, brought into the
world by Christ, did not create sin but made
it manifest, and gave it the appearance of
reality under our present conditions of life
and thought. How well the Mystic Paul understood
that the Invisible is the Real, and
that the Visible&mdash;namely, the phenomena of
nature&mdash;is only dependent upon Time for its
manifestation. His words are: "For the
things which are seen are temporal, but the
things which are not seen are Eternal."</p>

<p>I have tried in these Views to use only
simple everyday language, and am fully
aware how inadequate are the words I have
employed; but my readers will have, I hope,
recognised how difficult, and in many cases
impossible, it is, in treating these metaphysical
subjects, to find words to express
the exact meaning; we have to describe
the Infinite in terms of the finite, and by
use of imperfect finite analogies to get a
glimpse of the otherwise unthinkable, and
even then it requires a mystical sense, or
what St. Paul called spiritual discernment,
to see beyond the physical mists. If the
whole of the phenomena of Nature must be
looked upon as the manifestation of the
Divine Noumenon, it follows that Matter is
as divine as the Spiritual, though not as
real; it is His shadow, or the outline of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
His very image, thrown upon the material
plane of our sensations; and the principle
of sympathetic action, upon which, as we
have seen, the whole power to influence
depends throughout the Universe, becomes
surely the best symbol we can use for
understanding the efficacy of prayer and the
connection between our Transcendental Self
and the All-loving. Realise that the Transcendental
Ego is a Spirit, and therefore
akin to the Great Spirit, not only in essence,
but in "loving and knowing communion,"
then look at my last experiment, where we
saw two material bodies (remember they are
shadow manifestations of the Reality) which
could influence each other from the fact that
they were akin, not only in substance, but
in perfect sympathetic communion.</p>

<p>If now we watch the shadows of two human
beings thrown upon a wall, and see those
shadows shaking hands and embracing each
other, are we not justified in concluding that
those images give us a true explanation of
what is really taking place? and is not that
exactly what I have done? have I not shown,
as I proposed to do, that it is possible by
examining the phenomena of Nature (the
shadows of the Reality) to reach that point
where we may even feel that we are listening
to, or having divulged to us, some of what may
be called the very thoughts of the Great Reality?</p>

<h3><a name="VIEW_FIVE" id="VIEW_FIVE"></a>VIEW FIVE</h3>

<h2>THE PHYSICAL FILM</h2>


<p>We have seen in former Views that the
whole Phenomenal Universe, as perceived by
our senses, and all intellectual thoughts or
concepts based on those perceptions, are, in
reality, only mists or shadows; they have no
existence apart from our physical senses,
and may be likened to a thin film, which at
death is pricked and passes away like a
scroll, leaving us face to face with the
Reality. We thus seemed to grasp that all
phenomena, including our Physical Egos, are
but the shadows or outline of the Reality,
as depicted on our limited plane of consciousness;
but these phenomena, having
Motion for their basis, are none the less
real to us under our present outlook, limited
as it is by conditioning in Time and Space,
and we have to deal with them as realities
in our everyday life. I want to make this
distinction clear in the present View.</p>

<p>Those of us who were youngsters in the
'sixties, and were fortunate enough to be
taken to that land of wonders for children,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the London Polytechnic, will remember seeing
what were called Professor Pepper's
Ghosts. By means of a large sheet of glass
on the stage, the <i>reflection</i> of a human being
(otherwise invisible), which we will call the
"<i>unreal</i>," was, by the audience, seen walking
alongside the people on the stage, and it
was impossible to say which was the real
and which the unreal. When the unreal was
made to appear further back on the stage,
it was apparently seen through the real
figures and they appeared as ghosts, for they
were seen to be transparent. If now we fix,
perpendicularly on a table, a small pane of
glass, and place, say, an orange in front and
another orange behind it, we can arrange
so that an observer, looking through the
glass, sees two oranges alongside each other,
one being the real and the other the unreal,
and, with proper lighting and dark background,
it is impossible to determine which
is which, as they are both apparently real
oranges. We will call the real, A, and the
unreal, B; we now also introduce a human
hand on both sides of the glass, and again
we have apparently two real hands close to
the oranges; if the real hand is now seen
to try to touch the B orange, it passes
through it, but it can take up the A; and
the same result is seen when the unreal hand
tries to grasp them, except that it can grasp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the B but not the A; it is, in fact, only the
unreal that can apprehend the unreal, and
the real the real.</p>

<p>The above simile may help some of my
readers to understand how the phenomena
of Nature, though having no real existence
apart from our senses, have the appearance
of reality to us, because both we and the
whole Phenomenal Universe are the unreal
of our analogy, namely, the reflection or
shadow of the Real on the physical plane.
If we run against a stone wall, which is
also part, with us, of the shadow, we hurt
ourselves and acknowledge its existence, but
to the Real it would not be an obstruction
at all, it is not there. We know that this
wall is not really solid, it is made up of
Atoms revolving round each other but never
touching, but the man in the street would
give as the reason why it hurt, that it was
dense, or what is called hard; if the wall
were made of hay, or cotton wool, or of
sunbeams, we should not suffer by running
against it; in fact, the denser anything
becomes, the more it shows its character of
being real to our senses. If we take this
as the true explanation for the Physical
Universe, we are met with something quite
beyond our powers of comprehension, when
we try to form a conception of the all-pervading
Ether; unless we may look upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
it as actually a <i>presentation</i> of the Reality
itself. If we wave our hand, we can feel
the obstruction of the air, but we cannot
feel the Ether. We think our earth very
solid, and we know it is rushing round the
sun at the enormous rate of 60,000 miles
per hour, but it finds no obstruction in the
Ether, there is no retardation of its velocity;
and yet the study of Radio-Activity has
quite lately shown us that that Ether is not
only as dense as iron, or a hundred or a
thousand times denser, but millions of times
denser than that metal; and yet it permeates
all matter like a sieve. In Sir Oliver Lodge's
words, "the Ether is so dense that matter
by comparison is like a gossamer or a filmy
imperceptible mist." We can, therefore, by
again using our "Ghost" analogy, understand
why matter cannot obstruct the Ether, or vice
versa; there is no perceivable friction between
them, unless, as I shall presently suggest, we
may find something akin to obstruction by
Matter, not to Ether itself, but to its pressure,
in the phenomenon of Gravitation.</p>

<p>The evidence we are gradually winning
from Radio-Activity seems to be leading us
to the conclusion that all forms of matter
are but different motions or strains in the
Ether (perhaps, as Lord Kelvin thought, in
the form of vortices), that the different
atoms of which matter is composed are, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
suggested in View Three, <i>apertures</i> of different
complexity of outline&mdash;namely, those
points at which Ether is absent or its density
attenuated. Have we not apparently here
another example of Positive and Negative,
the Invisible the Ether, as the Real, and the
Visible, the Material Universe, as its Negative
the Unreal, similar to our list of Positives and
Negatives in View One? Ether itself cannot
be explained by any of the known dynamical
laws, though it is probably the very root and
cause of all of them; it is absolutely beyond
our plane of perception or conception. We can
only perceive certain effects of its presence
when it comes into our limited world of consciousness,
under the aspects of Time and Space&mdash;namely,
in its movements, which we classify
as forms of matter and modes of energy.</p>

<p>It is only lately that we have been able
to see clearly that the effects known to us
as Light, Heat, Electricity, and Magnetism
are caused by pulsations or rills of different
rapidity in the Ether (this will be referred
to in a later View); it is also probably the
cause of what we call Gravitation, and we shall
see that the action of Gravitation may, after
all, be not in the direction of a pull but must
be looked upon as a pushing force. Gravitation
is common to all matter; in common
language, every particle attracts every other
particle with a force directly proportional to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
its mass, and inversely to the square of its
distance; it is a very weak force compared
with others we know, and difficult to measure
except when a large mass of matter is involved.
Perhaps this will be clearer, and not
far from the truth, if I say that the force of
Gravitation exerted between two masses of
matter compared with that which we find
acting between the constituents of matter&mdash;namely,
in chemical affinity, is comparable to
the difference existing between the density
of matter and the density of Ether.</p>

<p>The latest calculation of the pressure of
the Ether is almost inconceivable&mdash;namely,
about 25,000 tons on the square inch, or
3,600,000 tons on the square foot; it may
well therefore be that, in the degree of permeability
of matter by the Ether, when we
can calculate it, will be found the explanation
of what we call Gravitation between two
masses; they are each shielding the other
from Ether pressure, in its own direction,
with an obstructive force equal to its mass.
The reason why the earth appears to attract
us, is that it is shielding us from a certain
amount of pressure in its direction; and we
know that we are also apparently attracting
every particle of the earth with a force proportionate
to our mass, because we are, however
slightly, shielding the earth from pressure
in our direction; if this is the true <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>explanation,
Gravitation is a phenomenon of the
Ether; it will be seen to be a movement of
matter in the line of least pressure, and is
therefore a push and not a pull.</p>

<p>Let us now come down to what we understand
better concerning the subject of this
View.</p>

<p>The question, "What is Truth?" "What is
the Reality?" goes to the very root of the
Riddle of the Universe. We are all trying
in one direction or another to answer this
question. As knowledge increases, old theories
become untenable and have to be discarded,
and, in their place, fresh ones are formulated
to account for new phases of phenomena.
There seems a general impression, among
even thinking people, that scientists are
wedded to, and always trying to find proofs
for, their last theories, but this is not the
case. The endeavour of the true seeker after
truth is not so much to discover fresh facts
which coincide with existing theories, as to
find phenomena which cannot be explained
thereby; there is indeed more joy over one
fact which does not agree with preconceived
theory, than over ninety-nine facts which
are found to fall under that heading. In
our everyday life we have become so accustomed
to take for granted that what we see,
hear, or feel by touch must be real, that it
is difficult for the man in the street to realise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
that our senses woefully deceive us; that perception
without knowledge often leads us
astray into false concepts, and these false
concepts lead us into difficulties which require
fresh concepts to be formed, and these
again demand further and more exact knowledge
to be applied to perceived phenomena.
This necessity for overcoming difficulties is
the greatest incentive we have for gaining
fresh knowledge of our surroundings. Owing
to the fact, as already pointed out, that our
sense perceptions are based upon the appreciation
of change or motion, and must therefore
be limited in Time and Space, and that
the trueness of our conceptions of the Reality
is dependent upon the knowledge which can
be brought to bear upon those perceptions,
we are forced to postulate two aspects of the
Universe; one of these is what may be called
the Visible, Finite, or Physical, which indeed
carries the appearance of Reality to our limited
senses, though it has no real existence for us
apart from those senses, and the other is
that which transcends our utmost conception,
which we call the Invisible, the Infinite,
or Spiritual.</p>

<p>At the outset of all investigation, we are
forced to recognise that the only way we
can approach conception of the Infinite is
necessarily in the form of a negative, the
negative applying to those things of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
we have cognisance; we carry our thought
to the utmost limit possible with our present
knowledge, and, when we have come to a
standstill, we conceive the Infinite to be not
that but something further on. As our knowledge
increases by small steps, that something
further on seems ever to be flying from our
grasp by mighty strides, until we are forced
to bow our heads and recognise that we are
in the presence of, though still not in sight
of, the Reality. A divine impulse is ever
urging us forward to greater conceptions
but shattering our hopes, and giving us a
feeling akin to despair, if we arrogate to
ourselves a greater power of conception than
we have knowledge to sustain; we have to
approach the study with, indeed, that feeling
of elation which the consciousness of our
origin and destiny wakes within us, giving
us a feeling of certainty that we are capable,
in the hereafter, of attaining to the highest
summit of knowledge, but with that humility,
in the present, which makes us acknowledge
that he who knows most knows most how
little he knows. In this frame of mind let
us now examine our surroundings.</p>

<p>We are living in a world of continuous
and multitudinous changes; in fact, without
change, we could have no cognisance of our
surroundings, we should have no consciousness
of living. We have become so accustomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to certain sensations that we are apt to take
them, as facts, and scoff at the suggestion
that they are non-realities. I propose, however,
to show that what we perceive are not
Realities, and true conception of our surroundings
depends upon the knowledge which
we can bring to bear to interpret the meaning
of these sensations. It is only in response
to our conscientious endeavours to form new
concepts that knowledge is being daily revealed
to us; the more we progress in
Knowledge the more we see that Perception
alone without Knowledge leads to false
concepts, and these in their turn create
fatal obstacles and difficulties to our progress
towards the true appreciation of the Universe.
Let me give a few examples.</p>

<p>In early times the Sun and the Stars were
seen to revolve round the Earth once every
day, and, without Knowledge of Astronomy,
this was taken for granted as an absolute
fact, and was looked upon as a reality; later
on, however, it was noted that the Stars
never changed their relative positions; this
necessitated a new concept, namely, that
they were fixed on the inner surface of a
huge globe, which was also revolving. This
false concept brought other difficulties into
play, the question arose as to what was
beyond the globe, and also the difficulty
that, when the Stars as well as the Sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
were found to be at such enormous distances
from the Earth, their rates of motion were
quite inconceivable. Even in the case of the
Sun the motion represents over twenty-five
million miles per hour, and the apparent
motion of the Stars is thousands of times
faster than Light travels. These insuperable
difficulties were not swept away until, by the
advance of Knowledge, the falsity of Conception,
based only upon appearance, was
made manifest, and it was seen that it was
the Earth which revolved and not the Stars.
Even then, owing to its supposed antagonism
to what was stated in the Bible, the new
Conception was opposed with great bitterness,
it being long looked upon and denounced
as a sacrilegious invention, and anybody
daring to promulgate such a doctrine was
threatened with death.</p>

<p>Our present Conception, that the Earth
turns round on its axis once every day, and
rolls in its orbit round the Sun once in
every year, may be called a Reality to our
finite Senses; but I shall show later on that,
except for the finiteness of our senses and
the imperfection of our Knowledge, the
Concept is not a true one. With perfect
Perception and perfect Knowledge we shall
see that, apart from the two limitations or
modes under which our physical senses act,
there can be no such thing as Motion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
because the very essence of Motion is but
the product of those limitations, namely,
Time and Space.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to take everything
for granted, that it may perhaps seem
strange to question whether it can even be
asserted that we have ever seen matter.
Let us turn towards a common object in
this room. We catch in our eyes the
multitudinous impulses which are reflected
from its surface under circumstances somewhat
similar to those in which a cricketer
"fields" a ball; he puts his hand in the
way of the moving ball and catches it, and,
knowing the distance of the batsman, he
perhaps recognises, by the hard impact of
the ball, that the batsman has strong muscles,
but he cannot be said to <i>see</i> the batsman by
that impact, nor can he gain thereby any
idea as to his character. So it is with
objective intuition; we direct our eyes
towards an object, and catch thereby rays
of light reflected from that object at different
angles, and, by combining all these
directions, we recognise <i>form</i>, and come to
the conclusion that we are looking at, say,
a chair. The eye also tells us that rays are
coming in greater quantity from some parts
of it, and we know that those parts are
<i>polished</i>; the eye again catches rays giving
higher or lower frequencies of vibration,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and we call that <i>colour</i>; our eyes also tell
us that it intercepts certain rays reflected
from other objects in the room, and we
know that it is not <i>transparent</i> to light;
and those are our sight perceptions of a
wooden chair.</p>

<p>We may go a little further by "pushing,"
when we know, by the amount of resistance
compared with the power exerted, what
force of gravity is being exerted by and on
that chair, and we declare it heavy or light,
but by these means we get no nearer to
the knowledge of what matter is. By tests
and reagents we can resolve wood into other
forms which we call Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen,
Nitrogen, &amp;c., which, because we cannot
divide them into any other known substances,
we call "Elements," but we can only look
at these in the same way as we are looking
at the chair. Chemists, however, carry us
a little further, and show us that the Elementary
substances have not only their likes
and dislikes, but their passionate desires and
lukewarmness to others of their ilk, and,
when opportunity offers, they break up with
great violence any ordinary friendship existing
between them and their neighbours, and
seize on their coveted prey with a strength
of will surpassing anything experienced in
the Organic World; and this new association
they maintain, until they, in their turn, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
dispossessed, or they encounter another substance
of still greater attraction, when they
leave their first love and take up new connections.</p>

<p>I shall touch upon the subject of what
matter is later on; meanwhile let us consider
how, owing to our senses being limited
by the considerations of Time and Space,
we are surrounded by inconceivables, and
yet it is those very inadequate conceptions
which force us to acquire Knowledge; the
greatest incentive we have to pursue our
investigation is, as we have seen, the fact
that Perception without sufficient Knowledge
leads us into difficulties. Let me give
you two instances of these inconceivables.
Infinite Space is inconceivable by us, but it
is also quite as inconceivable, or perhaps even
more so, to think of Space being limited, and
yet we are forced to declare that one of
these two must be true. Again, Matter is
either composed of ultimate bodies, of a
certain size which cannot be divided, or is
infinitely divisible; both of these are inconceivable,
the latter for the same reason as
that of the Infinity of Space, and the former
because it is inconceivable that the ultimate
body could not be divided into two parts by
a sharp edge forced between its two sides,
or by a stronger force than at present holds
it together; it has indeed been suggested as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
an explanation that, if an atom could be
divided, it might cease to be matter, that its
parts would have no existence, but it is
difficult to conceive how two nothings can
form one something.</p>

<p>Another example of Perception leading to
a false Concept is our Sense of Pain; we
apply a red-hot coal to the tip of one of our
fingers and our Perception would have us
believe that we feel intense pain at the point
of contact, but we know this to be a false
Concept, as it can be shown that the pain
is only felt at the brain: there are in communication
with different parts of our body
small microscopical nerve threads, any of
which may be severed with a pen-knife close
to the base of the skull, with the result that
no pain can then be felt, although the fingertip
is just as much alive and is seen to be
burning away.</p>

<p>Another example is our Sense of Hearing.
A musical sound is made up of a certain
number of pushes in a second, but each push
is silent. It is only, as we have seen, a musical
sound to our Sense when the pushes recur
at intervals of not more than the sixteenth
part of a second. The prongs of a tuning-fork,
vibrating 500 times per second, seem
to be travelling very quickly, but are really
only moving at the rate of 10 inches per
second, or not much over half a mile per hour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
when the amplitude is the hundredth part of
an inch, which gives quite a loud sound.</p>

<p>Light is also composed of rills in the Ether,
but the rill itself is not Light, it is only Light
when these rills strike, with a certain enormous
frequency, on a special organ adapted
for, we might say, counting these frequencies,
and if these frequencies fall below that certain
number, or above twice that number per
second, there is no Sense of Sight.</p>

<p>How few people have ever realised what a
wonderful Counting Machine they possess in
their organ of Sight! I think the best method
I can adopt, to bring this clearly before you,
is to take our tuning-fork, vibrating 500
times per second, a rapidity which to some
will be even difficult to comprehend, and then
ask you to consider how long that fork must
continue to vibrate before it has accomplished
the full number of frequencies, which must
necessarily impinge upon the eye in one
second of time, before the phenomenon of
sight becomes possible. That tuning-fork
would have not only to continue its vibrations
without diminution for seconds, minutes,
hours, weeks, months, years, or hundreds of
years, but for 30,000 years before it has
accomplished the full number of pulsations
which, as Ether waves, must strike the eye
in one second of time, to give the impression
of Light; the calculation is easy, the rills of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Red Light are so small that 40,000 of these
only cover one inch of length, and light
travels 186,000 miles per second. If therefore
the number of inches in 186,000 miles are
multiplied by the 40,000, and the product is
divided by the 500 times which the tuning-fork
vibrates in one second, you have the
number of seconds that tuning-fork must
vibrate, before it has completed the number
of impacts which, in one second of time, must
fall on our retina to give us the impression of
red light; and that tuning-fork would have
to vibrate nearly twice as long, say 50,000
years, to reach the number of impulses which
strike the eye in one second of time and give
the impression of violet light; and between
these two limits are situated the colours&mdash;Orange,
Yellow, Green, Blue, and Indigo.</p>

<p>What a marvellous sense then is Sight,
when we find that, not only can it grasp
these innumerable vibrations, but can actually
differentiate colours, appreciating as a different
colour each increase of about one-tenth in
these multitudinous frequencies; and it is
principally by means of this Sense of Sight
that we gain a knowledge of what is happening
around us. And yet what strides we have
made in the last two hundred years to improve
upon that instrument! With all its
wonderful capabilities, we shall see later on
that the eye is a very imperfect instrument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
for seeing very small objects, or even large
objects when at a great distance. With the
present compound Microscope, only developed
in the last hundred years, and its apochromatic
lenses, invented only in the last forty
years, we are able to see and photograph
objects of a minuteness immeasurably beyond
the power of the human eye, and, with
our telescopes, we can see and photograph
stars far beyond the possibility of vision by
the unaided eye; and yet, by the stellar
spectroscope, we are actually able to examine
and identify the very atoms of which that
distant star is composed, or rather was composed
hundreds of thousands of years ago;
we can compare those atoms with the same
atoms in our laboratories, and we find that,
though the former are hundreds of thousands
of years older than the latter, they show
absolutely no signs of wear or loss of energy,
though they have been for that enormous
time, and are still, pulsating at the rate of
not only millions but billions of times per
second; and though the pulsations they emit
have travelled across such a vast depth of
space that the mind cannot even imagine the
distance, there has not been any diminution
in the numbers of pulsations per second, nor
the slightest slowing down of the rate of
flight at which they started on their journey
from that far-off world. If there had been the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<i>slightest</i> change we could detect it at once
by means of the Spectroscope.</p>

<p>With another instrument we are able, not
only to hear but to converse audibly, as long
as we like, with another human being a
thousand miles away, who is also sitting
comfortably in his own arm-chair and speaking
to us with as much freedom as though we
were both in the same room. With another
instrument we can go further, and exchange
thoughts, in a few seconds, with a being on
the other side of the world, by means of a
thin wire that is itself fixed, and does not
move, and we have lately invented another
means by which we can do the same, over
several thousands of miles, without even a
connecting wire. With another instrument
we have gone far beyond the facility with
which the Printing press enabled us to communicate
our thoughts to our fellow human
beings, we can actually imprint our very
words and laughter upon a wax cylinder and
send it to the antipodes, and our friends
there, with a similar instrument, can not only
hear and recognise our very voice, but can
make that voice repeat our thoughts audibly,
to a thousand others at the same time, and
can repeat that process for hundreds of times
without exhausting that voice. With another
instrument we can depict on a film, not only
the images of our friends but their very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
actions, which may also be sent to any
distance, and the persons, thereon depicted,
may be seen by their relatives alive and
going about their everyday employments,
with every movement exact to life. We can
cross the Ocean against the wind and waves
by means of harnessed sunbeams, without
any exertion of our own, at the rate of an
express train, which train, by the by, is also
moved by the same means; we can dive to
the bottom of the sea and journey there for
hours, in perfect safety, without coming to
the surface, and we are even developing
wings, or their equivalent, which from immemorial
tradition we were not to possess
before we had finished doing our duty properly
in this world and had gained admission to the
next.</p>

<p>We can do all these things, but how ignorant
we still are in the commonest doings
of Nature! By giving up our whole lifetime,
and spending millions of pounds, we could
never make a grain of wheat or an acorn, and
wherever we turn we find ourselves confronted
with mysteries beyond our power
to explain from a finite material standpoint;
even in material vibrations we meet a mystery
almost beyond our power to comprehend.
Take for instance those small insects, of the
family of Grasshoppers, which make the
prim&aelig;val woods of Central America give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
out a noise like the roaring of the sea, a
wondrous sound never to be forgotten by
those who have heard it. By means of a kind
of rasp one of these insects creates a sound
which Darwin states can be heard to the
distance of one mile: these insects weigh less
than the hundredth part of an ounce, and
the instrument by which the noise is made,
weighs much less than one-tenth of the
total insect; it is less therefore than one
thousandth part of an ounce in weight, and
yet it is found, by calculation, that this small
instrument is actually able to move at the
enormous rate of a thousand vibrations per
second and keep in motion for hours, from five
to ten million tons of matter, and it does this
so powerfully that every particle of that
enormous bulk of matter gives out a sound
audible to our ears. But even these millions
of tons are not its limit of action, for we
know that these vibrations must go on until,
in the end, every particle of matter connected
with this earth has been affected by each of
those vibrations.</p>

<p>All our difficulties of understanding the
true meaning of these and other phenomena
around us are, as I have already pointed out,
caused by our inability to recognise that
vibration or motion has no reality, it is a
pseudo-conception arising from the fact that
our senses are entirely dependent upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
two modes or limitations, Time and Space,
for their very action, and that, as conceptional
knowledge is based upon perceptional knowledge,
our very consciousness of living is also
dependent upon these same limitations. We
have seen that Motion is nothing but the
product of these two modes of perceptions,
and, in my next Views, I shall examine these
elusive limitations, these two mysteries of
Time and Space, the forever and the never-ending;
I shall trace them to the utmost
limit of our conception, and try to gain thereby
a clearer insight into the fact, not only
that the whole Physical Universe is but a
transient and Space-limited phenomenon, a
thin film which our senses have erected and
which divides us from the Reality, but that,
if our power of <i>introspection</i> were fully developed,
we should know that the Reality is
nearer and dearer to us, and has much more
to do with us, even in this life, than has the
physical.</p>

<h3><a name="VIEW_SIX" id="VIEW_SIX"></a>VIEW SIX</h3>

<h2>SPACE</h2>


<p>We have seen that our very thoughts, and
therefore consciousness of living, are limited
by Time and Space, but we cannot with the
utmost endeavour conceive a limit to Time
and Space; they are two twin sisters, alike
in many respects but different in others, and
we shall realise later on that they are readily
interchangeable. The sensuous aspect of
Motion is, as we have seen, the time that an
object takes to go over a certain space&mdash;namely,
what is called the rate at which it
passes from one point to another, and we
cannot imagine Motion unless it contains
both of these modes in however small a
quantity; we may have the greatest imaginable
space traversed in a moment of time,
or the smallest imaginable space covered in
what may be called, for want of a better
word, an eternity, but we still have to postulate
what we call Motion; this, of course,
follows from the fact that our thoughts require
both these modes for forming concepts.
If we compare our conception of
Matter with that of Time and Space, we see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
that the two latter are not separately the
object of any sense, but are the modes or
conditions under which all our senses act, to
a greater or less degree, and these conditions
cannot therefore carry the same impression
of objectivity to our senses as Matter does,
except perhaps in the sense that all physical
phenomena are simply motion, and motion
is the product of both of these limitations
but not of either of them separately.</p>

<p>If we analyse our conceptions of Time and
Space we seem forced to postulate that they
are both infinitely divisible and infinitely extensible;
they are both what is called continuous
and not discrete, we cannot conceive
any minimum in their division; both duration
in Time and extension in Space can be
reduced, as it were, to a mathematical point;
nor can we conceive any maximum in either
duration or extension. They are both therefore
comprised in every conception possible
to our consciousness; all parts of Time are
time and all parts of Space are space; there
are no holes, as it were, in Space which are
not space, nor intervals in Time which are not
time, they are both complete units; Space
cannot be limited except by space, and Time
cannot be limited except by time. So far
they are alike, but, on the other hand, Space
is comprised of three dimensions&mdash;namely,
length, breadth, and depth, whereas Time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
has the appearance to us of comprising one
dimension only&mdash;namely, length.</p>

<p>Under our present conditions we can only
think of one finite subject at a time, and,
at that moment, all other subjects are cancelled.
We can therefore only think of points
in Time and Space as situated beyond, or in
front of, other fixed points, which again must
be followed by other points; we cannot fix a
point in either so as to exclude the thought
of a point beyond; we can only in fact examine
them in a form of finite sequences.</p>

<p>The Idea of Infinity, which we shall refer to
in a later View and show to be a false conception,
is therefore a necessary result of the
limitation of our thoughts; our physical Ego
cannot conceive beyond the Finite as long as
we are conscious of living under present conditions.
With every act of perception by our
senses, we have therefore not only intuition
of the Visible or Finite, but we become at the
same moment aware of an Invisible Infinite
beyond. Time appears to us as an inconceivable,
intangible something, which gives us the
impression of movement without anything
that moves it. Space is an omnipresent, intangible,
inconceivable nothing, outside of
which nothing which has existence can be
even thought to exist. Let us now try and
get an insight into what we mean by perception
of distance in space.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The appreciation of distance depends upon
what is called <i>parallax</i>, or the apparent displacement
of projectment of an object when
seen by our two eyes separately. If you
hold up a finger and look at it, with each
eye separately, you will see that the finger
is projected by each eye on to a different part
of the background; the angle which the lines
of sight, from each eye, make when they meet
at the object, is called the angle of parallax,
and the further the object is away the smaller
that angle becomes; it is, in fact, the angle
subtended, at the object, by the distance between
the two eyes. As the object is brought
nearer the eyes have to be inclined inwards
to impinge on that object; the appreciation
of distance then, in our sense of sight, is dependent
upon our perception of the amount
of inclination of those two lines of sight, and
is therefore an acquired knowledge. The distance
between the eyes is about 2-1/2 inches, and
this is a very short base line upon which to
estimate distance; in fact, without the help
of perspective and known dimensions of surrounding
objects, it is doubtful if anyone could
by its means estimate distance beyond a few
hundred yards. The object would, of course,
also have to be an unknown one, as, otherwise,
the converse of the above comes into
play, and the distance could be estimated by
the angle which the known diameter of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
object subtends at the eye; but this necessitates
the size of the object being known beforehand
and the employment of perspective.</p>

<p>We can extend our perception of distances
by, ourselves, moving from one place to
another, gaining thereby a longer base line,
and noting the displacement of projection of
the object on a distant background; by that
means, distance up to several miles can probably
be appreciated. But, when we try to
determine the distance of, say, the Moon
(240,000 miles away), we are helpless, especially
as we have no marked background, except
in the case of occultations of the Sun or
Stars. But the Astronomer at once comes
to our aid; a distance of several miles is
carefully measured on a level plane, and, by
placing telescopes at the extremities of that
known line, we can mark the inclination of
those telescopes to each other when focussed
upon a particular mountain peak on the
moon; by this means we know the angle
of parallax (180&deg; less the sum of the two
angles of inclination), and, from this and
our known length of base line, we can calculate
the distance. When however we go
a step further and attempt to calculate the
distance of the Sun (93,000,000 miles), we find
our last base line again absolutely inadequate.
But the astronomer helps us again;
we now separate our two telescopic eyes by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the whole diameter of the earth (7900 miles);
this is accomplished by taking from the Equator
two simultaneous observations of the Sun, at
its rising and setting; for when the Sun is
setting, at say the Equinox, it is at that
moment rising at exactly the other side of the
earth; the inclination of the two telescopes,
directed to a certain point on the Sun, will
now give the distance approximately, though
even this base line is too short for exactitude.
When however we attempt to go
still further and try to ascertain the distance
of stars, which are a million times
further off than the Sun, such a base line is
quite out of the question. How then can we
get a base line for our telescopes longer than
the whole width of the earth? The Astronomer
again provides the means. The earth takes
one year to complete its vast orbit round
the sun, and the diameter of that path is
186,000,000 miles. This is made our new base
line for separating our telescopes; an observation
of a star is taken, say, to-day, and after
waiting six months, to enable the earth to
reach the other extremity of its vast orbit,
another observation is taken, and yet it is
found, as we shall see later on, that the distance
of the nearest fixed star is so <i>stupendous</i>
that even this base line, of 186,000,000 miles,
shows absolutely no inclination between the
two telescopes except in about a dozen cases,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and even in those the angle of parallax, perceivable,
is so minute that no reliable distance
can be calculated; we can only say that the
star is at least as far away as a certain distance,
but it may be much farther.</p>

<p>Let us now try by other means to get a
clearer insight into the subject of this View,
by tracing Space to the utmost limit of
human conception. I think the best method
I can adopt will be to take you, in imagination,
for a journey as far as is possible by
means of the best instruments at our disposal.</p>

<p>We will start outwards from the Sun, and
glance on our way at the worlds involved
in the Solar System. Let us first understand
what are the dimensions of our central
Luminary. The distance of the Moon from
the Earth is 240,000 miles, but the dimensions
of the Sun are so great that, were the centre
of the Sun placed where the centre of the
Earth is, the surface of the Sun would not
only extend as far as the Moon, but as far
again on the other side, and that would give
the radius only of the enormous circumference
of the Sun; another way to understand its
size is, to remember that, light travelling
186,000 miles per second, would actually take
five seconds to go across its disc. Let us now
start outward from this vast mass. The
first world we meet is the little planet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Mercury, only 3000 miles in diameter, revolving
round the Sun at a distance of
36 million miles. We next come upon Venus,
at a distance of 67 million miles. She is
only 400 miles smaller in diameter than our
Earth, and, with the dense atmosphere with
which she is surrounded, animal and vegetable
life similar to that on our Earth
would be possible. Continuing our course,
we arrive at our Earth, situated 93 million
miles away from the Sun. Still speeding on,
a further 50 million miles brings us to Mars,
with a diameter of nearly 5000 miles, and
accompanied by two miniature moons. The
sight of this planet in a good instrument
is most interesting. Ocean beds and continents
are visible, and the telescope shows
large tracts of snow, though not necessarily
formed from water (perhaps carbonic dioxide),
surrounding its polar regions, which increase
considerably during the winter, and decrease
during the summer seasons on that planet;
but there are no canals! The fact that our
largest and best telescopes failed to show
these imaginary canals, was an insurmountable
barrier to the advocates of these
markings, but the "Canalites" made their
contention ridiculous when they actually
suggested that the reason for this failure to
perceive them was that our telescopes were
too large to see such small markings! How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
such a statement could have been made is
incomprehensible on any supposition, as
everybody knows that the whole use of
size, or what is called aperture, in a telescope,
is to help us to see more clearly small
and faint markings.</p>

<p>The distances we now have to travel
become so great that I shall not attempt
to give them; you can, however, form an
idea of the tremendous spaces we are
traversing when you consider that each
successive planet is nearly double as far
from the Sun as the preceding one.</p>

<p>In the place where, by Bode's law, we
should expect to have found the next world,
we find a group of small planets, ranging
in size from about 200 miles in diameter
down to only a few hundred yards. They
pass through nearly the same point once in
each of their periods of revolution round
the Sun, and it has been suggested that
they are fragments of a great globe rent
asunder by some mighty catastrophe; over
400 of these little worlds have been discovered
and have received names, or are
known under certain numbers.</p>

<p>We now continue our voyage over the
next huge space and arrive at Jupiter, the
largest and grandest of the planets. This
world is more than 1000 times larger than
our Earth, its circumference being actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
greater than the distance from the Earth
to the Moon. It has seven moons, and its
year is about twelve times as long as ours.
Pursuing our journey, we next come to
Saturn. It is nearly as large as Jupiter,
and has a huge ring of planetary matter
revolving round it in addition to seven
moons. Further and further we go, and
the planets behind us are disappearing, and
even the Sun is dwindling down to a mere
speck; still we hurry on, and at last alight
on another planet, Uranus, about sixty times
larger than our Earth; we see moons in
attendance, but they have scarcely any light
to reflect; the Sun is only a star now; but
we must hasten on deeper and deeper into
space. We shall again, as formerly, have
to go nearly as far beyond the last planet
as that planet is from the Sun. The mind
cannot grasp these huge distances. Still we
travel on to the last planet, Neptune, revolving
on its lonely orbit; sunk so deep
into space that, though it rushes round the
Sun at the rate of 22,000 miles per hour,
it takes 164 of our years to complete one
revolution. Now let us look back from this
remote point. What do we see? One planet
only, Uranus, is visible to the unaided eye;
the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, have
disappeared, and the Sun itself is now only
a star; practically no heat, no light, all is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
darkness in this solitary world; the Sun is
1000 times smaller than we see it from
the earth, and gives, therefore, only one-thousandth
part of its heat and light.
Thus far have we gone, and, standing there
at the enormous distance of 3,000,000,000
miles from our starting-point, we can begin
to comprehend the vast limits of the solar
system; we can begin to understand the
ways of this mighty family of planets and
satellites. But let us not set up too small
a standard whereby to measure the Infinity
of Space. We shall find, as we go on,
that this stupendous system is but an infinitesimal
part of the whole universe.</p>

<p>Let us now look forward along the path
we are to take. We are standing on the
outermost part of our Solar System, and
there is no other planet towards which we
can wing our flight; but all around are
multitudes of stars, some shining with a
brightness almost equal to what our Sun
appears to give forth at that great distance,
others hardly visible, but the smallest telescope
increases their number enormously, and
presents to our mind the appalling phantom
of <i>immensity</i> in all its terror, standing there
to withstand our next great step. How are
we to continue on our journey when our
very senses seem paralysed by this obstruction,
and even imagination is powerless from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
utter loneliness? One guide only is there
to help us, the messenger which flits from
star to star, universe to universe; Light it
is which will help us to appreciate even
these bottomless depths. Now, Light travels
186,000 miles per second, or 12 million miles
every minute of time. It therefore takes
only about four hours to traverse the huge
distance between our Sun and Neptune,
where we are now supposed to be standing;
but to leap across the space separating us
from the nearest star, it would require many
years for Light, travelling at 186,000 miles
every second of that time, to span the
distance. There are, in fact, only fifteen
stars in the whole heaven that could be
reached, on the wings of Light, in sixteen
years!</p>

<p>Let us use this to continue our voyage.
On a clear night the human eye can perceive
thousands of stars, in all directions, scattered
without any apparent order or design; but in
one locality, forming a huge ring round the
heavens, there is a misty zone called the
Milky Way. Let us turn a telescope with a
low aperture on this, and what a sight presents
itself! Instead of mist, myriads of
stars are now seen surrounded by nebulous
haze. We put a higher aperture on, and thus
pierce further and further into space; the
haze is resolved into myriads more stars, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
more haze comes up from the deep beyond,
showing that the visual ray was not yet strong
enough to fathom the mighty distance; but let
the full aperture be applied and mark the result.
Mist and haze have disappeared; the telescope
has pierced right through the stupendous distance,
and only the vast abyss of space, boundless
and unfathomable, is seen beyond.</p>

<p>Let us pause here for a moment to think
what we have done. Light, travelling with
its enormous velocity, requires on an average
considerably over ten years to traverse
the distance between our Solar System
and Stars of the first magnitude, but
the dimensions of the Milky Way are built
up on such a huge scale that to traverse
the whole stratum would require us to pass
about 500 stars, separated from each other
by this same tremendous interval; 10,000
years may therefore be computed as the
shortest time which light, travelling with its
enormous velocity, would take to sweep
across the whole cluster, it being borne in
mind that the Solar System is supposed to be
located not far from the centre of this great
star cluster, and that the cluster comprises all
stars visible arrayed in a flat zone, the edges
of which, where the stratum is deepest, being
the locality of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Let us once more continue our journey.
We have traversed a distance which even on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the wings of light we could only accomplish
in many thousands of years, and now stand
on the outskirts of our great star cluster, in
the same way, and I hope with the same
aspirations, as when we paused the last time
on the confines of our Solar System. Behind
us are myriads of shining orbs, in such countless
numbers that human thought cannot
even suggest a limit, and yet each of these is
a mighty globe like our Sun, the centre of a
planetary system, dispensing light and heat
under conditions similar to what we are accustomed
to here. Let us, however, turn our face
away from these clusterings of mighty suns,
and look steadfastly forward into the unbroken
darkness, and once more brace our nerves to
face that terrible phantom&mdash;<i>Immensity</i>.</p>

<p>We require now the most powerful instruments
that science can put into our hands,
and by their aid we will again essay to
make another stride towards the appreciation
of our subject. In what, to the unaided
eye, was unbroken darkness, the telescope
now enables us to discern a number of
luminous points of haze, and towards one
of these we continue our journey. The
myriads of suns in our great star cluster are
soon being left far behind; they shrink together,
resolve themselves into haze, until the
once glorious universe of countless millions
of suns has dwindled down to a mere point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
light, almost invisible to the naked eye. But
look forward: the luminous cloud to which we
are urging our flight has expanded, until what,
at one time, was a mere patch of brightness,
has now swelled into a mighty star cluster;
myriads of suns burst into sight&mdash;we have
traversed a distance which even on the wings
of light would take hundreds of thousands of
years, and have reached the confines of another
Milky Way as glorious and mighty as
the one we have left; whose limits light
would require 10,000 years to traverse; and
yet, in whatever direction the telescope is
placed, star clusters are to be seen strewn
over the surface of the heavens.</p>

<p>Let us take now the utmost limit of telescopic
power in all directions. Where are we
after all but in the centre of a sphere whose
circumference is 100,000 times as far from us
as one of the nearest fixed stars, a distance that
light would take over a million years to traverse,
and beyond whose circuit, infinity, boundless
infinity, still stretches unfathomed as ever?
We have made a step, indeed, but perhaps
only towards acquaintance with a new order
of infinitesimals. Once the distances of our
Solar System seemed almost infinite quantities;
compare them with the intervals between
the fixed stars, and they become no
quantities at all. And now when the spaces
between the stars are contrasted with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
gulfs of dark spaces separating firmaments,
they absolutely vanish away. Can the whole
firmamental creation in its turn be nothing
but a corner of some mightier scheme? But
let us not go on to bewilderment: we have
passed from planet to planet, star to star,
universe to universe, and still infinite space
extends for ever beyond our grasp. We have
gone as far towards the infinite as our sight,
aided by the most powerful telescope, can
hope to go. Is there no way then by which
we can continue our journey further towards
the appreciation of this infinity? A few years
ago we should probably have denied that it
was possible for man to go further; but quite
lately a new method of observation has been
developed, and we will try and use this to
continue our flight.</p>

<p>The reason why, to our sight, an object
becomes apparently smaller and smaller as it
is withdrawn from the eye, until it at last
disappears entirely, is that the eye is a very
imperfect instrument for viewing objects at
a great distance; it can only form an image
of an object when that object is near enough
to subtend a certain angle, or, in popular
language, to show itself a certain size&mdash;the
rays of light must converge&mdash;in fact, the eye
cannot single out and appreciate parallel
rays: could it do this, objects would not
appear to grow smaller as they are removed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
A pencil might be removed to the Moon,
240,000 miles away, and would still appear to
the eye the same size as it does here close to
you; with perfect vision there would be no
such thing as perspective, but, with our
present conditions of sight, the result would
be inconvenient. We should never be able
to see, at one and the same time, anything
larger than the pupil of our eye. The
beauties of the landscape would be gone, and
our dearest friends would pass us unheeded
and unseen; everyday life would resolve
itself into a task similar to that of attempting
to read our newspaper every morning
by means of a powerful microscope; we
should commence by getting on to a big
black blotch, and, after wandering about for
half an hour, we might perhaps then begin to
find out that we were looking at the little letter
"e," but anything like reading would be quite
out of the question. We may, therefore,
with our limited aperture of sight, be thankful
that our eyes have the imperfection of
not appreciating parallel rays. But we will
now consider how this imperfection may be
remedied by science.</p>

<p>There are two different ways of doing
this&mdash;viz., first, by increasing the amount
of light received, by means of telescopes of
great aperture; and secondly, by employing
an artificial retina a thousand times more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
sensitive than the human. Now, the human
retina receives the impression of what it
looks at in a very minute fraction of a
second, provided of course that the eye is
properly focussed, and no further impression
will be made by keeping the eye fixed on that
object; but in celestial photography, when
the telescope is turned into a camera, the
sensitive plate, having received the impression
in the first second, may be exposed not only
for many seconds, or minutes, or hours, but
for an aggregate of even days by re-exposure,
every second of which time details on that
plate new objects, sunk so deep in the vast
depths of space as to be immeasurably beyond
the power of the human eye, even
through telescopes hundreds of times more
powerful than the largest instruments that
science has enabled us to construct; and yet
here is laid before us a faithful chart, by
means of which we may once more continue
our journey through space. A short exposure
will show us firmaments and nebul&aelig;
just outside the range of our greatest telescopes,
and every additional second extends
our vision by such vast increases of distances
that the brain reels at the thought; and yet,
as we have seen, exposures of these sensitive
plates may be, and have been, made not only
for seconds, but for thousands and even
hundreds of thousands of seconds! And still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
there is no end, no end where the weary mind
can rest and contemplate; the finite mind of
man can only cry out that there is no limit.
In spite of all its strivings and groping by
aid of speculative philosophy, the finite cannot
attain to the Infinite, nor get any nearer to
where the mighty sea of time breaks in noiseless
waves on the dim shore of eternity.</p>

<p>In this journey through space we have apparently
exhausted our power of conception of
the <i>extension</i> of this View. Although we have
travelled in one direction only, our flight was
applicable to every possible known direction
<i>outwards</i> into the vast abyss of Infinite space.
But there is another path, by which we can
also travel with profit to our understanding
of this subject, running in the opposite direction&mdash;namely,
<i>inwards</i>. Just as the outward
journey seemed to take us towards the appreciation
of what our finite senses call the
infinitely great, so does this other path appear
to intend to infinity, in the opposite direction,
leading us to appreciate what is called the
infinitely small. We have already considered
this direction in View One, under the heading
of "Relativity," and by combining these
two experiences, we may see still more
clearly that our very conception of Space
is one of the modes only under which
motion or physical phenomena are presented

<h2>TIME</h2>


<p>In the last View I referred to the mysteries
of Time and Space as twin-sisters; they have,
as we saw, many aspects in common, and are
the two modes or conditions under which all
our senses act and by which our thoughts are
limited. We arbitrarily divide each of these
two mysteries into two parts, which parts are
separated from each other, in either case, by a
point which has, apparently, as its centre, our
very consciousness of living. In the case of
Space we call this point the <span class="smcap">Here</span>, and on one
side of it, as we saw in our last View, we have
extension towards the infinitely great, and,
on the other, intension towards the infinitely
small. In the case of Time we call the middle
point the <span class="smcap">Now</span>, and on one side of this we
place the duration of Time towards the
future, and, on the other, we place what we
call the duration of Time towards the past.
In the case of Space we have the here and
the <i>overthere</i>, equivalent in Time to the present
and the <i>future</i>, but, though Time and
Space are, as it were, twin-sisters, upon whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
combined action depends our very consciousness
of living, we do not treat them both equally.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the human
race on this particular world has, in some
inexplicable way, come to look upon the
future as non-existent until we arrive at, and
are able to perceive, with our senses, what
is happening there; this is all the more inexplicable
when we realise that in traversing
Space we certainly have to <i>move</i> to get anywhere,
but in traversing Time we have nothing
equivalent to movement. This curious way
of looking upon the future as non-existent,
may be another sign that our race is still in its
infancy, but is more probably caused by human
beings having always hitherto looked upon
Time not only as a reality but as actually
moving or extending along a line from past
to future eternity; whereas, under our present
outlook, we have no consciousness of
the existence of Time except by intervals
between successive thoughts; our consciousness
of the very existence of Time is based
upon our Physical Ego repeating the <i>present</i>,
by saying to itself the words, Now&mdash;Now&mdash;Now;
but there is nothing that can be called
movement in this, any more than if you are
standing still and saying, Here&mdash;Here&mdash;Here&mdash;relating
to Space. Time is, as it were,
"marking time," and as the present in time
is common to all space, Time is "marking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
time" everywhere, and the Now therefore
includes the whole of the past and the whole
of future eternity everywhere. We shall get
a clearer understanding of this later on;
meanwhile, we are face to face with the fact
that we look upon the future as non-existent.</p>

<p>This curious state of things is probably only
accidental to the present stage of development
of the human mind, and may, at any
time, be rectified by perhaps either a slight
rearrangement of that slender network of
nerves upon which depends our faculty of
thinking, or the joining together of a few
microscopical filaments attached to the cells
in the grey cortical layer, or even a single
bridge thrown across from one convolution
to another of the brain; a very slight alteration
would open up to our consciousness the
present existence of the future. The prime
perceivable difference between our brains
and those of the Apes and lower animals is
the larger number of enfoldments, or convolutions,
that are developed by the Human.
Each new line of thought, or sequence of
thoughts, requires, and is provided with, a
new wrinkle or small convolution, and it
probably only requires the attention of the
human race to be fixed, for a time, on the
consideration of this subject, to evolve the
slight alteration, or bridge, necessary to
enable us to see that the future, as also the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
past, does actually exist and is included in
the Now. It may make this a little clearer
to consider that if you maintain that, in
traversing the duration of time, the future
does not exist until you arrive there, you
should also in fairness insist that, in travelling
through the extension of Space, your destination,
say Rome, does not exist until you
get there and can see it with your senses.</p>

<p>As we have, in the former six Views, been
gradually mounting above the mists and
illusions of our everyday thoughts, and can
look through our Window with, I hope, a
clearer vision, I shall venture in this present
View to carry the subject of the <i>Future</i> still
further, and show that, just as we have now
before us and can read the papyri which
were written 5000 years ago, so it is possible
to conceive that books, written and being
written and printed 5000 years hence, are
<i>at present</i> in existence, and that it is even
possible the human race has actually already
read them; whether we shall be able to see
them and read them in our own lifetime may
be open to question; that may again depend
upon the development of special cross-circuiting
of brain filaments. Meanwhile, in order
to carry our present View to the utmost limit
of our conception, in a manner somewhat
similar to what we did for Space, I will
again ask you to join me in a thought-flight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
towards the appreciation of this second
great Mystery.</p>

<p>With this object in view we will first
consider the human senses of sight and
hearing, commencing with sound, or the
vibrations which affect the tympanum of the
human ear. Sound travels in air at about
1130 feet per second, and if the vibrating
body, giving out the sound, oscillates sixteen
times in one second, it follows that,
spreading over this 1130 feet, there will be
sixteen waves, giving a length of about
70 feet to each wave. This is the lowest
sound that the human ear can appreciate
as a musical note, and is, what may be
called, the fourth Octave above one vibration
in one second. When the number of
vibrations in a second sinks below sixteen,
the ear no longer appreciates them as a
musical sound, but is able to hear them as
separate vibrations or beats. The easiest
way of illustrating this is by means of a
revolving disc, with sixteen holes pierced at
regular intervals round the edge, and a jet
of high-pressure air, which is forced through
each of the holes successively as they revolve.
When the disc does not quite complete
one revolution in a second, only fifteen
puffs come to the ear in a second of time,
and they are heard as puffs; but when the
rate reaches one revolution in a second, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
sound, as if by magic, changes into the
lowest musical sound. The same result may
be obtained in a more pronounced form by
means of explosions or pistol shots; when
these are slow and heard separately, they
are painful and almost unbearable to the
ear, but, as soon as their rapidity, namely,
at sixteen per second, gets beyond the power
of the ear to differentiate between the explosions,
the impression, as if by magic,
changes into a continuous or musical sound,
like a thirty-foot pipe note of an organ.</p>

<p>To go back to our disc. The octave
above this lowest musical note is obtained
by doubling the rate of puffs, namely, by
revolving the disc twice in one second, and
the next octave by revolving four times in
a second, and so on, doubling each time,
until, at about the thirteenth octave, the
sound has become so high that the majority
of listeners cannot hear it, and fancy it must
have stopped, whereas a few will still be
saying: "How shrill it is!" At last, at
about the fourteenth octave, when there are
20,000 beats to the second and each wave is
about half an inch long, it passes beyond
human audition, and, although we can show
that the air is still vibrating, all is silent,
the human ear being incapable of hearing so
many beats in a second even as a continuous
sound, though I have evidence to show that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
many insects can hear probably considerably
beyond this limit. It is, however, possible
to make these higher vibrations perceptible
to our senses by means of what are called
sensitive flames: we can actually, by these,
measure the length of these silent waves,
and as we know the rate at which they
travel, we can at once compute the number
which occur in a second of time, and thus
ascertain their pitch. By this means we can
follow for about three more octaves above the
audible limit, namely, up to 160,000 pulsations
per second, with a length of wave of
one-twelfth of an inch.</p>

<p>Two and a half octaves above these numerically,
<i>i.e.</i> at about the twentieth octave,
we reach the frequency of Electro-Magnetic
Rills, used by the Marconi System of wireless
telegraphy, which pulsate at about 950,000
per second, and have a wave-length of something
like 1000 feet. The reason for this
great increase in length of wave is caused
by these frequencies being propagated in
the Ether at the rate of 186,000 miles per
second, instead of, as with sound waves, in
the air, at only 1130 feet per second. We
can trace these particular frequencies, called,
after their discoverer, Hertzian waves, for
about fifteen octaves, when we arrive at the
frequency of 32,000,000,000 in a second, with
a wave-length decreased to a quarter of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
inch; we can render the effect of these
waves visible, but have no physical organ
by which we can feel these pulsations. After
this, however, we get into the region of
frequencies which, though still of exactly
the same kind, we know and can feel as
Radiant heat; these are situated in the next
fourteen octaves, and bring us up to those
subtle frequencies which affect another of
our sense organs, and which we appreciate
as light; these we have already seen have
the enormous frequency of 530,000,000,000,000
pulsations per second for red light, up to
930,000,000,000,000 per second for violet, and
having wave-lengths so small that it takes
40,000 and 70,000 of them respectively to
cover one inch in length. There is only a
little over half an octave that the eye can
appreciate as light, and then all is darkness;
but we can still go on further by the help
of Science: beyond the violet we have the
actinic or chemical rays, which are used in
photography, and which enable us to trace
the frequencies for a further two octaves.
Beyond this we cannot pierce with our present
knowledge; but there may be, and probably
are, latent in our nature, senses which,
properly developed, will be able to appreciate
still more subtle vibrations, and organs
which, perhaps, even now are being prepared
for the reception of these influences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>We have no organs yet developed for receiving
and appreciating what are called
Wireless waves, but we have already been
able to devise physical Receivers, of wonderful
sensitiveness, for them and other waves of the
same nature, such as those of Radiant heat.
In the case of Radiant heat, the Bolometer
invented by Professor Langley has been able
to receive and record a change of temperature
of the one millionth of a degree Centigrade,
and can easily make visible the heat of a
candle at a distance of one and a half miles.
In wireless telegraphy also the Receiver,
perfected by Marconi, is affected by rills,
made by a splash of electric discharge, over
3000 miles away. If our eyes were sensitive
to these frequencies, both of which are
composed, as is also light, of electro-magnetic
rills, we could see anything that was happening
anywhere in the world, for they go
through matter as though it did not exist,
as light passes through glass; indeed, if our
region of Sight waves was only put an
octave lower we could not use glass in our
windows, it would be too opaque, we should
be obliged to have our windows made of
thin slabs of carbon or other substances
permeable to Radiant heat waves. Science
indeed steadily points to electricity and
magnetism being a form of motion, and it
may be that in these invisible rays we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
some day discover the nature of those
mysterious forces; and, even far beyond
those, as suggested in View Four, we may
in the not far distant future be able to
appreciate Physical Life itself as a mode of
frequency.</p>

<p>We want, as it were, a special "Time Microscope,"
which I have already referred to, to
examine these vibrations, and a method similar
to that already mentioned in "Space," under
Celestial Photography, by which we may
traverse and examine hundreds or thousands
of octaves by each second of exposure; for,
although the path extends to infinity, we have
already arrived at the utmost limits of our
finite senses, and find that after all we can
only appreciate fifty-one octaves, a few inches
only, as it were, along the line of Infinite
extent, reaching from the finite up to the
Reality; and even so it must be borne in mind
that we have only travelled in one direction,
whereas the path we have taken extends in
the opposite direction also to infinity. We
started with sixteen vibrations in a second,
as the lowest number of beats we human
beings can appreciate as a musical sound; let
us now descend by octaves. The octave below
is eight vibrations in a second, and there are
probably many animals that can only hear
these as a musical sound; the next octave is
four, then two, and then one vibration in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
second. But we do not stop there; the octave
below this is one vibration in two seconds,
then in four seconds, eight seconds, sixteen
seconds, and so on, until it is possible to conceive
that even one frequency in a million
years might be appreciated as a musical
sound, or even as one of the colours of the
spectrum, by a being whose time sensations
were enormously extended in both directions,
but still finite.</p>

<p>Once more we must call a halt. Our finite
minds become bewildered in attempting even
to glance at these infinities of time.</p>

<p>We measure space by miles, yards, feet, and
inches; we measure time by years, hours,
minutes, and seconds; and by these finite
units we try to fathom these two marvellous
infinities. With our greatest efforts of
thought we find, however, that we can get
relatively no distance whatever from the
<span class="smcap">Here</span> of Space and the <span class="smcap">Now</span> of Time. It is
true that the present, as a mathematical
point, appears to be hurrying and bearing
us with it along the line stretching from the
past to future eternity, but in reality we get
no further from the one nor nearer to the
other. Let us change our view and examine
this subject under a different aspect.</p>

<p>First of all, look round a room and note the
different objects to be seen. Even in a small
room we do not see the objects as they really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<i>are</i> at this instant, but only as they <i>were</i> at a
certain fixed length of time ago. The present
time is common to every point in space and
each person is in the present, but only to his
own perception; to everyone else in the room,
each individual is, at this moment, being seen
acting in the past; those objects which are
further away are being seen further behind
in point of time than those that are nearer;
in fact, however near we are to an object, we
can never see it as it is but only as it was.
We are dealing with very minute differences
here, they being based upon the rate at
which light travels; but they are differences
which are known with a wonderful degree of
accuracy.</p>

<p>We have here another example of how
perception without knowledge leads to false
concepts. When anyone views an extended
landscape, he thinks that his sight shows him
that the same point of Time, which he is
experiencing, is common to every man, animal,
plant, or material visible there, but we know
now that he is seeing every part of that scene
in the past compared with himself. Just as
all objects therein are situated at separate
distinct points of space, so to our vision the
objects of that scene are acting or existing in
different epochs of time. An Artist gives us
on a flat surface a picture of that landscape,
and his representations of all objects in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
scene appear therefore to us as being in the
same moment of Time, but to get that effect
he has to draw objects at a distance smaller
than those close at hand; a fly in the foreground
has to be drawn larger than a horse
supposed to be in the distance, though both
are on the same flat surface; they have the
same parallax and are therefore the same
distance from the observer, and as this produces
a similar image on our retina, we accept
it though we know it is only a make-believe;
it serves its purpose by giving us an impression
on our retina which we have learnt to
interpret as representing that landscape, but
such a picture would indeed be a marvel of
absurdity to a being who had perfect sight,
such as we have already referred to, and
who could appreciate parallel rays; in such
a vision there would be no perspective, no
vanishing point in perception.</p>

<p>Now let us take a wider landscape. The
Moon is 240,000 miles distant. We do not,
therefore, ever see her as she is but as she
was 1-1/4 seconds ago. In the same way we
see the Sun as he was eight minutes ago, and
we see Jupiter as he was nearly an hour ago.
Let us look still further to one of the nearest
fixed stars. We at this moment only see that
star as it was more than ten years ago; that
star may therefore have exploded or disappeared
ten long years ago, and yet we still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
see it shining, and shall continue to see it
<i>there</i> until the long line of light has run
itself out; all around us, in fact, we see the
appearance of blazing suns not as they are
now but as they were thousands of years ago,
and, by the aid of the telescope and of our
sensitive plate, we are only now recording
the light which started from clusters and
firmaments probably millions of years ago.</p>

<p>Now let us take the converse of this. To
anybody on the moon at this moment the
earth would be seen from there not as it is,
but as it was 1-1/4 seconds ago, and from the
sun as it was eight minutes ago, and if we
were in Jupiter, and were looking back, we
should, at this particular moment, be viewing
what was happening on this earth, and seeing
what each of us was doing an hour ago.
Now let us go in imagination to one of the
nearest fixed stars, and looking back we
should see what was happening ten years
ago; going still further to a far-off cluster,
the light would only just now be arriving
there, which started from the earth at the
time when man first appeared; or we might
go to so remote a distance that the scene
of the formation of the Solar System would
be only now arriving there, and all the events
which have taken place from that remote
time to the present would, as time rolled on,
reach there in exactly the same succession as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
they have happened on this earth; and remember
that we should be looking, from that
great distance, at all these past events with
the same intuitional advantage as though we
were actually present here in time, for however
near we are to an object, we never see it
as it is but only as it was in the past.</p>

<p>Let us but turn to any point of space and
we shall find at each point, according to its
remoteness, the actual scenes of the past
being enacted, in fact it may be said that
throughout infinite space every event in past
eternity is now indelibly recorded.</p>

<p>A murder committed hundreds of years
ago, in a country house, may never have
been found out, the criminal and his victim
have alike turned to dust, the blood has been
washed from the floor, the very house and its
surroundings have crumbled and disappeared,
and in their place a waving corn field is all
that can be seen, but at this very moment if
we were at a certain point in space, we should
now be witnessing there, the whole actual
living scene from beginning to end, as though
we were present <i>here</i> hundreds of years ago:
the murderer standing over his victim, the
knife driven in and the blood gushing out.
If we went further away we should at this
same moment be seeing the criminal just
arriving and knocking at the door of that
house, then going upstairs into the room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and the same terrible scene with all its
minuti&aelig; would again be enacted. From a
point still further removed, we should now
see him, say, having lunch at a country inn
some miles away, concocting his villainy, then
he would be seen walking across the fields
towards the house, again knocking at the
door, mounting the staircase, and once more
would that murderous scene be enacted before
our eyes, and so on for ever; the scene, with
the house and its surroundings, have indeed
been completely swept away from the present
<i>here</i>, but the whole tragedy will always be
acting in the future <i>there</i> in the presence of
the Reality.</p>

<p>Let us now come, in imagination, towards
the earth, from some far-off cluster of stars.
If we traverse the distance in one year, the
whole of the events from the formation of
this world would appear before us, only
thousands of times quicker. Make the journey
in a month, a day, an hour, a second,
or a moment of time, and all past events,
from the grandest to the most trivial, would
be acted in an infinitesimal portion of time.</p>

<p>When we have fully grasped this we recognise
that Omniscience is synonymous with
Omnipresence, and some may find, in this
thought, a glimpse of that Great Book wherein
are said to be registered every thought,
word, and deed, which, in the direction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Reality, has helped to nourish, or, in the
direction of the shadow, has tended to starve
the personality of each one of us; for we
know that every word we utter, or that has
been uttered from the beginning of the world,
and every motion of our brain connected with
thought is indelibly imprinted upon every
atom of matter. If our sense of perception
were greatly increased we need not go to
Palestine to see on the rocks there the
impressions of the image of Christ and His
disciples, or of the words they uttered as they
passed by, but any stone by the wayside <i>here</i>
would show His every action and resound
with every word He uttered. In fact, every
particle of matter on this earth is a witness
to that which has happened, every point in
space and every moment of time contains the
history of the past in the smallest minuti&aelig;.
The <i>Here</i>, embracing all space, and the <i>Now</i>,
embracing all time, are the only realities to
the Omniscient.</p>

<p>Let us once more change the scene and we
may grasp even more clearly that Time and
Space are not realities but are only modes or
conditions under which our material senses
act. A tune may be played either a thousand
times slower or a thousand times quicker, but
it still remains the same tune, it contains the
same sequence of notes and proportion in
time, the only characteristics by which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
recognise a tune. And so in the same way
with our sense of sight, an event may be
drawn out to a thousand times its length or
acted a thousand times quicker, it is still the
same scene. An insect vibrates its wings
several thousands of times in a second and
must be cognisant of each beat, whereas we
have seen that we, with our Senses of Sight
and Hearing, can only appreciate respectively
at the most seven and sixteen vibrations in a
second as separate beats. That insect must
therefore be able to follow a flash of lightning
under the conditions of a Time microscope
magnifying a thousand times compared with
our vision. The whole life of some of these
insects extends over a few hours only, but
owing to their quick unit of perception it is
to them as full of detail as our life of seventy
years; but to them there is no day and night,
the Sun is always stationary in the Heavens,
they can have no cognisance of Seasons.</p>

<p>I have already referred in View One to
the curious results of increasing our unit of
perception by a Time Microscope, and I will
now carry the investigation of this subject a
step further.</p>

<p>As conceptional knowledge is based on
perceptional knowledge, and we can only
perceive about six times per second, and as
the principal forms of knowledge are gained
through the eye, we are conceiving progress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in phenomena under a very restricted outlook;
we cannot recognise such slow motions
as, for instance, the hour-hand of a watch,
the growth of a tree, or rise of the tide,
except by noting the change that has occurred
after a long interval; there is therefore a
whole world of events which we cannot see.
Owing to this limit, in our unit of time
perception, we also cannot perceive events
which are taking place beyond a certain
quickness, they become blurred and give the
impression of continuity, and constitute another
world of events lost to us. For the
same reason there is a whole world of sensation
lost to us by our limited unit of sound
perception; we cannot follow separate sound-events
if they occur quicker than sixteen in a
second, beyond that they become blurred and
give the impression of continuity. If, on the
other hand, our units of perception were
increased a thousandfold, as is probably the
case with some insects, our conscious lives
would contain a thousand more events than
they do at present, and, as the consciousness
of length of life is dependent upon the number
of events that have been perceived, we should
under these conditions have passed on this
earth a life equivalent to, say, 70,000 years
under our present restricted unit; every
second of that long period would have been
as full of events for us as is a second in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
present life of seventy years. If, on the
other hand, our unit of perception were
decreased a thousandfold, our length of life,
based upon perception of events, would be
no longer than 25-1/2 of our present days; if
our life were actually reduced to that period
(so as to regain our present units of perception)
we should be old and grey-headed before
the sun had risen for the twenty-fifth time
since our birth. If our unit of perception,
with our length of life, were again reduced
a thousandfold, the whole of our life of
seventy years would now only be equal to
forty-three minutes, and, in the whole of that
life, we could only see the sun move ten degrees,
namely, twenty of its own diameters in
the heaven; if we were born, say, at noon on
midsummer's day, we could never have any
idea of anything but daytime, and neither
our fathers, nor grandfathers, nor great-grandfathers
for fifteen generations before
them could have seen the sun rise; but there
would have been a tradition, handed down
from a far distant past generation, that a
long time ago, beyond the memory of man,
there was no sun at all, everything was pitch
dark, and that time was called the "Great
Shadow." If their records could have gone
still further back for the same length of time
they would have heard that, before the "Great
Shadow," the sun was always shining in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
heavens, and that that great "Sun" day
lasted twice as long as the great shadow.</p>

<p>To understand more clearly this subject of
Time perception let me put another aspect
before you; we are looking, say, at an insect
whose wings are beating several thousand
times per second, and, with our vision limited
to six times per second, it would be impossible
to count the number of hairs on that wing, or
to see which of those hairs were split, or were
bent from the straight, but, if we travelled
away from that insect into space at the rate
of light, and were looking back, the present
would then always be with us; the wing,
although still vibrating at that enormous
rate, would appear to be stationary, and so
would every other moving thing on the
earth, however quick its movement, and
everything would continue in that motionless
state for a million years, provided we continued
our flight with the rays of light. If
we travelled a little slower than light, say
one minute less in a thousand years, the same
scene would be presented to us, but, that
which was acted upon this earth during one
minute of Time, would now take a thousand
years to accomplish; the swiftest railway
train would appear standing still, it would
take 5-3/4 days and nights to cover each inch of
ground. It is thus possible to again understand
how the flight of a bird or the lightning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
flash might be examined under conditions of
time which would lead to the discovery and
tracing of even the principle of life itself.
But let us go one step further and increase
our flight beyond the rate at which light
travels: scenes would now progress in the
opposite direction to that which we are
accustomed to; men would get out of bed
and dress themselves at night and go to bed
in the morning; old men would grow young
again; tall trees would grow backwards and
enter the earth, embedding themselves in the
seed, and the seed would rise upwards to the
branch that nourished it; the blood would
turn into chyle, into food in the stomach,
into the piece of meat, which would be transferred
from the mouth to the plate, and
would then be cut on to the joint, the joint
would go down to the kitchen and be uncooked,
would be carried to the butcher to
be cut on to the carcase, and the animal
would come to life and go out into the fields.
Human bodies would be formed in the ground
from the dust of the Earth, passing through
what we call corruption to incorruption, the
dead would be taken from their graves,
brought back to their homes and put to bed;
the Doctor would arrive, a miracle would
happen, the patient would come to life;
though this would hardly be a feather in the
cap of the Doctor, as it would be seen that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the medicine came out from the mouth of
the patient, would be put into bottles to be
thrown away, and it would be the Doctor
who had to pay the Fee, and the bigger the
Doctor the bigger the Fee he would have to
pay. The future would in fact change places
with the past, the effect would give birth to
the cause as presented to our finite senses,
and, though it is difficult to realise, it is
indeed just as true, or untrue, that we come
into this world through the grave, instead of
in the way we are accustomed to, because to
the Reality there is no change, the Here and
the Now comprising all beginnings and ends,
all causes and effects.</p>

<p>In this flight on the wings of light we did
not in reality depart in the least from the
Here, because there is no such thing as space,
it is all included in a mathematical point, the
Here; and as the whole of time is included in
the Now, the Future, however remote with
all events therein, is existent in the present;
the writers of books 5000 years hence are
therefore writing them now, and the Human
Race has read and is reading them <i>now</i>; we
have always hitherto maintained that these
things are only "going to happen" 5000 years
hence, but in reality all events in the future
are events in the same Now in which we are
living at the present moment, and, as it is
just as true, that time is flowing from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Future to the Present and on to the Past, as
in the contrary direction (of our present outlook),
so it is quite conceivable that we may
some day, in the not far distant future, not
only realise that the future exists already, but
that we may even be able to handle and read
the books written 5000 years hence, in a
similar manner to that which enables us
now to handle and read those which were
written 5000 years ago.</p>

<h3><a name="VIEW_EIGHT" id="VIEW_EIGHT"></a>VIEW EIGHT</h3>

<h2>CREATION</h2>


<p>In our first View we saw the necessity of
clearing away the weeds, the moss, and the
lichen from the stem of our Real Personality
before that Transcendental Self could send
forth fresh buds for the advancement of
<i>conscious</i> thought to higher levels; we found
that the first step towards this clearing the
approach to our window, was to recognise
that a knowledge of the Truth was to be
gained by the use of "Introspection" rather
than by Intellectualism&mdash;to realise, in fact,
that it is not we, with our intellects, who
are looking out upon Nature, but that it is
the Absolute looking into us and ever trying
to teach us divine truths concerning the
"Reality of Being." We saw that the phenomena,
which our senses would have us believe
to be the reality or solidity of our material
surroundings, are illusions created by the
fact that those senses are limited in their
perception to that which is conditioned in
Time and Space, necessitating <i>motion</i> as the
basis of our perceptions, and that, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
rate of motion exceeds our units of perception,
we have the impression of continuity
of events, which we accept as the objective
existence of matter; we also saw that the
duration of Time and extension of Space
had no existence for us apart from those
senses, our very consciousness of these two
non-realities depending upon "relativity"&mdash;they
could, in fact, be increased or diminished
indefinitely, without our knowing that any
change had been made.</p>

<p>In our second View I attempted to take
another step forward by showing how, by
means of this "Introspection," it was even
possible to understand that these two limitations
might be eliminated from consciousness;
we then realised that the whole Physical
Universe is but a thin film, set up by our
finite Senses, between our Consciousness and
the "Reality of Being"; we saw that this
could only be understood when, by the Mystical
Sense, we realised that physical phenomena
were but symbols or shadows of the
Reality or Noumenon underlying them.</p>

<p>In our next View I gave an example of the
use of Mystical and Symbolical thought, leading,
in the fourth View, to the subject of
Everlasting Life and the Efficacy of Prayer,
wherein I tried to show that by examining
the phenomena of Nature, as depicted on the
Physical Film, it is possible to reach a point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
where we may even feel that we are actually listening
to, or having divulged to us, the
very thoughts of the Absolute. This led to
the next View, where we examined the
Physical Film itself, and this we analysed
in the next two Views into those component
parts, by means of which this Film presents
to our senses the impression of the whole
Physical Universe as an objective reality.</p>

<p>We have seen that it is the Invisible which
is the Real, that the visible is only its
shadow; that the Invisible, as distinguished
from the Visible, is not in a place apart
from the Physical, but is the Reality of which
the visible constitutes the boundary lines or
planes in our consciousness, as lines and
planes are the visible boundaries of solids.
The Kingdom of Heaven is not a locality but
a <i>state</i> of Divine "loving and knowing communion";
it is within us in the sense that
we are interior and not exterior entities of
the "Reality of Being."</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a point where we
can better realise that the Absolute cannot
be localised or bounded by space, and must
be Omnipresent&mdash;cannot be conditioned in
Time, and must therefore be Omniscient&mdash;the
Here comprising all Space, and the Now all
Time in the "Reality of Being."</p>

<p>With these conclusions before us I will
ask you to form a new conception of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Creation. All creation around us is the
materialisation of the Thought of the Deity.
He does not require time to think as we
do&mdash;the whole of the Universe is therefore
one instantaneous Thought of the Great
Reality; the forming of this world and its
destruction, the appearance of man, the
birth and death of each one of us are
absolutely at the same instant; it is only
our finite minds which necessitate drawing
this Thought out into a long line, and our
want of knowledge and inability to grasp
the whole, which force us to conceive that
one event happened before or after another.
In our finite way we examine and strive to
understand this wondrous Thought, and at
last, a Darwin, after a life spent in accumulating
facts on this little isolated spot of
the Universe, discovers what appears to be
a law of sequence, and calls it the evolution
theory; but this is probably only one of
countless other modes by which the <i>intent</i>
of that Thought is working towards completion,
the apparent direction of certain
lines on that great tracing board of the
Creator, whereon is depicted the whole plan
of His work.</p>

<p>Let me give a simple example of Creation
by a "word," which even our finite minds
can grasp. When I utter the word <i>Cat</i>, it
starts a practically instantaneous thought in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
your minds, the power of that thought being
dependent upon the knowledge you have
gained. If you analyse it you will find that,
though practically instantaneous, it comprises
all the sensations you have ever felt on that
subject throughout your life. It commenced,
perhaps, when you were only a year old,
and, sitting on your mother's knee, your
hand was made to stroke a kitten, and you
felt it was soft and it gave you pleasure.
Later on, when you were older, you had it
in your arms, and you felt the first intimation
of that wonderful "&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#951;," which manifests
itself in most children in their love for
dolls; you found it delightful to cuddle and
that it purred. Later on, you found that it
played with a reel of cotton, and that it
could scratch, make horrid noises, and countless
other things, which not only make up
the life of a cat, but connect it with the
world around us. All these thousand and
one facts are now drawn out, by analysis
in Time and Space, into a long line, and
are placed one in front of the other; but
the thought started by the word Cat was a
fair example of an instantaneous creation.</p>

<p>One other example of an instantaneous
thought. Let us suppose a large room fitted
with, say, a hundred thousand volumes, comprising
all the knowledge gained by every
Specialist in every Science concerning the plan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of Creation. In our finite minds, under the
limits of Time and Space, the word representing
the contents of that library would
start, when uttered, an instantaneous thought
analogous to that of our last example, according
to the knowledge that each individual
had already acquired of the contents of those
books; but this knowledge had only been
gained by taking down each volume separately
and reading one book at a time, beginning
at the beginning and taking each page and
each word in succession, and a lifetime would
not suffice to enable us to read them all;
whereas, if our knowledge were <i>complete</i>,
the word representing the contents of that
room would start an instantaneous thought,
comprising not only every book, but every
chapter, page, word, letter, and punctuation
contained in that library, or in one which
comprised all knowledge from the beginning
to the end of Time.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that at the approach
of death, when the perceptive senses are completely,
or almost completely, in abeyance, as
in the "self-forgetting" referred to in "The
Vision," the duration of Time appears to have
no reality; in numerous cases of drowning,
where the person has been no more than
one or two minutes under water, the whole
of a long life, with every forgotten trivial
occurrence and the multitude of thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
attached thereto, have been brought vividly
before the mind, as it were, instantaneously;
those also who have been put under nitrous-oxide
gas, though the life of the body is
not affected, know how, with departure of
sense perception, the sense of Time is completely
annihilated. I have myself experimented
under such conditions, and attempted
to realise the duration of time by counting
steadily, one, two, three, four, &amp;c., and had
no knowledge whatever that between, say,
"four" and "five" there was a complete
hiatus of several minutes when, for me, time
had vanished; I was still counting steadily
when the an&aelig;sthetic had passed away, and
it was quite impossible to realise that such
time had elapsed, as I had not reached more
than the twelfth count, whereas, according
to the time expired, I should have reached
the fiftieth or sixtieth. A number of examples
of what may be called instantaneous thoughts
created in the mind of a sleeper have been
collected, and many of us have had similar
experiences. I give one as an example:
"Maury was ill in bed and dreamed of the
French Revolution. Bloody scenes passed
before him. He held long conversations with
Robespierre, Marat, and other monsters of
that time, was dragged before the tribunal,
was condemned to death, and carried through
a great crowd of people, bound to a plank.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
The guillotine severed his head from his
shoulders. He woke with terror to find that
a rail over the bed had got unfastened and
had fallen upon his neck like a guillotine,
and, as his mother who was sitting by him
declared, at that very moment."</p>

<p>In the above case the whole scene was
started instantaneously in his brain, but in
waking his mind analysed it in Time and
Space and spread it out into a long historical
record. The opposite process to this, namely,
the building up a thought-picture, is what we
do every day when we form and combine our
conceptions under the dominion of Time and
Space, until we have accumulated in our
minds a multitude of concepts which form as
it were a single subject, somewhat analogous
to a painter when he has completed his
picture, a writer his book, an architect his
house, or even a mechanic his machine. An
interesting example of a musician constructing
a thought-picture is given by Mozart himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When I am all right and in good spirits,
either in a carriage or walking, and at night
when I cannot sleep, thoughts come streaming
in and at their best. Whence and how I
know not, I cannot make out. The things
which occur to me I keep in my head, and
hum them also to myself&mdash;at least others have
told me so. If I stick to it, there soon come,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
one after another, useful crumbs for the pie,
according to counterpoint, harmony of the
different instruments, &amp;c. This now inflames
my soul, that is if I am not disturbed. Then
it keeps on growing, and I keep on expanding
it more distinctly, and the thing, however long
it be, becomes indeed almost finished in my
head, so that I can always survey it in spirit
like a beautiful picture or a fine person, and
also hear in imagination, not indeed successively,
as by and by it must come out, but
all together. That is a delight! All the invention
and construction go on in me as in
a fine strong dream, but the overhearing it
all at once is still the best."</p></div>

<p>With these illustrations before us may we
not carry the analogy even further, and see
that, as our conception of a Cat was made up
of numberless small acquisitions of knowledge,
some of which had to be discarded, or eliminated
as errors, from our minds as our knowledge
grew, and as each true fact became
confirmed and impressed upon our brain it
made itself a <i>permanent</i> record and became
a centre to be used for gaining further knowledge;
so in this wonderful Thought of the
Great Reality, whose mind may be said to be
omnipresent, each individual soul is a working
unit in the plan of Creation; each unit
as it gains a knowledge of the Will of the
Deity forms for itself a <i>personality</i> helping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
forward the work towards its fulfilment;
without that knowledge there can be no
personality, no unit in the great completed
thought, no life hereafter.</p>

<p>The True Life is fulfilled by him who has
progressed so far in the knowledge of the
Divine as to realise that he is the offspring of
the Absolute, and therefore stands face to
face with his Transcendental Personality, his
&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;, of which the Physical Ego is only
the outline or boundary form visible in the
physical universe. Each individual has free
will to define his own boundaries, his own
limitations; he builds up the walls of the
house in which he lives, and he has power to
brick up or open out the windows through
which he may see the Truth; happy are those
whose windows are open, but many, alas,
choose to make the wall opaque by confining
their attention to the physical shadows, or
by strangling their spiritual intuition and
preventing all advance in thought by blind
subservience to obsolete dogmas.</p>

<p>We are instruments of Divine purpose in
the scheme of Creation. Each individual
Physical Ego seems to be a Micro-Cosmos,
imaging the Universe, the Macro-Cosmos.
As the phagocytes, the policemen of the
blood, flock to a breach in the human body
to overcome any invasion of the enemy,
whether poisons or bacteria, which would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
otherwise detract from that progress of cell
formation upon which the scheme of human
life depends, so do the true lovers of the
Divine meet, by active resistance, any attempt
of the enemies of the Good, Beautiful
and True to retard the advancement of
the scheme of Creation to its ultimate goal
of perfection. The human body is composed
of innumerable cells and several special
colonies of cells, which we call organs, each
of which has its special work to do, and
secretes and discharges special fluids necessary
for the welfare of the whole body. All
of these cells are alive, and myriads of them
are moving on their own account, apparently
quite independent of, and in complete ignorance
of, the feeling and perception of the
whole body; they are, however, microscopical
units of that body, and its welfare depends
upon their contribution of work; it is, in fact,
only through their ceaseless activities that the
life in that body is maintained&mdash;a phenomenon
analogous to that described in the simile of
a Forest Tree in View Four. So are we
integral parts of the scheme of Creation, and
each act, either in accordance with the Divine
purpose or the reverse, is helping forward or
retarding the completion of that Thought,
though like the cells we are ignorant of the
end which Creation has in view.</p>

<p>In this life we seem indeed to be only, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
it were, in embryo! The study of embryology
has lately shown us clearly how the
clothing of our Physical Ego has been formed,
during the past millions of years, from the
lowest forms of life. Each one of us has,
during what may be called his lifetime, gone
through all the different stages of evolutionary
development which, since the beginning
of life on this planet, have been employed
to build up the human body in its present form.
Embryology has shown us that, during gestation,
each human embryo is a <i>replica</i> of the
past; it passes through the different Imago
stages from protoplasm to man, being unrecognisable
at certain stages from a monad,
an am&#339;ba, a fish with gills, a lizard, and a
monkey with a tail and dense clothing of hair
over the whole body. The human embryo has
also, at an early stage, the thirteenth pair of
ribs, which is found in lower animals and is
still seen in a rudimentary form in anthropoid
apes, but which disappears from the human
embryo before birth. Each generation, under
evolutionary development, will witness a further
advancement in the clothing of the
Physical Ego, until it may be conceived that
a hundred thousand years hence our present
stage of development will be seen only as one
of the stages through which the embryo has
to pass before birth at that distant time. May
we not even glimpse at the future to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
evolution is carrying us? For in any of these
stages we see organs forming whose use only
comes into play long after that stage has been
passed; so also, in the new rudimentary forms
of thought which are started by every fresh
discovery may we not some day be able to
descry the heights which we are destined to
attain if we earnestly seek after Truth?</p>

<p>Radio-Activity has shown us that all forms
of matter are but different combinations of
one primal brick; by synthesis thousands of
new forms of matter, unknown in Nature,
are actually now being built up in our laboratories,
and the number of such combinations
cannot conceivably be limited; so do we also
see that all the known forms of energy in
nature are interchangeable, one with another,
with exactly known equivalents and ratios,
pointing to their being only different combinations
of one unit of energy. If such is the
case, it would seem to follow that there are
countless other forces of which we at present
have no cognisance, but which may at any
time come within our field of investigation.</p>

<p>In our life here we are steadily progressing
from the lower to the higher form of being,
from the purely Physical towards the Transcendental,
each generation starting from a
higher level; the boundary line between the
Physical and Transcendental is being continually
advanced towards the latter, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
may well be, as I have already suggested in
View IV, that we are even now on the eve of
discovering a new force, or aspect of Creation,
which will open a wider view and give us a
clearer knowledge of the goal which we are
destined to reach hereafter.</p>

<p>Each generation will, according to the
teaching of Embryology, gradually come into
the world at a higher stage of development
than its predecessors, until the last Physical
Ego, at its birth, will coincide with the final
stage of development, when there will be no
more physical clothing, the disintegration of
Matter being completed, and, it can be pictured
that at the final consummation, there
will be nothing imperfect, no shadow left, that
all will be spiritual. The object of Creation
would therefore appear to be the population
of the Real Universe with spiritual entities,
until the whole Spiritual Universe will be
taken up by Transcendental Personalities,
which will be one with the Reality, and the
Great Thought completed.</p>

<p>Once more let us recognise that we are
dependent for knowledge of surroundings
upon our perception of movements, and that
as our conceptional knowledge is based on
perceptional knowledge, our thoughts are
limited by Time and Space and can only
deal with finite subjects. From this arises
all our difficulty of understanding the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>Infinite;
we cannot under our present conditions
know the whole Truth; if we could
do that we should be able, as it were, to
look all round the subject, and Infinity
would then be seen to be a pseudo-conception
of our finite thoughts. We can only
think of one finite subject at a time, and, at
that moment, all other subjects are cancelled;
we can, in fact, only think in sequences, and,
taking the particular Infinities of duration
and extension which we have been examining,
we can only think of points in Time and
Space as existing beyond or before other fixed
points, which again must be followed by other
points. We cannot fix a point in Time or
Space so as to exclude the thought of a point
beyond; the idea of an Infinite is therefore
a necessary result of the limitation of our
thoughts. The whole Truth is there before
us, but we can only examine it in a form of
finite sequences. A book contains a complete
story, but we can only know that story by
taking each word in succession and insisting
that one word comes in front of another, and
yet the story is lying before us complete.
So with Creation; we are forced to look upon
it as a long line going back to past eternity,
and another long line going on to future eternity,
and, with our limitations, we can only
think of all events therein as happening
in sequence; but eliminate Time and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
become Omniscient, the whole of Creation
would be before us as an Instantaneous
Thought of God.</p>

<p>Accordingly under the dominion of Time
we appear to be in a similar position to
that of a being whose senses are limited to
one-dimensional space&mdash;namely, to a line;
we can only have cognisance of what is in
front and behind, we have no knowledge of
what is to the right or left, we appear to
be limited to looking lengthwise in Time,
whereas an Omniscient and Omnipresent
Being looks at Time crosswise and sees it
as a whole. A small light, when at rest, appears
as a point of light, but when we apply
quick motion, the product of Time and Space,
to it, we get the appearance of a line of light,
and this continuous line, formed by motion
of a point, is, I think, analogous to the Physical
Universe appearing to our finite senses as continuous
in Time duration and Space extension,
though really comprised in the Now and the
Here, the whole of Creation being therefore
an Instantaneous Thought.</p>

<p>A consideration of our limitation in Space
may also be useful to show how impossible
it is for us to hope to see by our senses
the Reality or by our thoughts to know
the Spiritual. Our senses and thoughts are
limited to a Space of three dimensions, and
we can therefore only see or know that part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of the Absolute which is or can be represented
to us in three dimensions; a being
whose senses were limited to a Universe of
one dimension&mdash;namely, a <i>line</i>, could have
no real knowledge of another being who was
in a Universe of two dimensions&mdash;namely, a
<i>flat surface</i>, except so far as the two-dimensional
being could be represented within his
line of sensation; so also the two-dimensional
being, on a <i>plane</i>, could have no true knowledge
of a being like ourselves in a Universe
of three dimensions. To his thoughts, limited
within two dimensions, a being like ourselves
would be unthinkable, except so far as our
nature could be made manifest on his plane;
so can it be seen that we, limited by our finite
senses to Time and Space, and our consciousness
dependent upon that limited basis of
thought, can only know that aspect of the
Reality which can be manifested within that
range of thought&mdash;namely, as Motion, or what
we call physical phenomena.</p>

<p>Let me attempt just one more view before
we part, which may make this conception of
Creation, as an Instantaneous Thought, even
clearer to our finite senses. Imagine a Spectator
endowed with the same sense of vision
that we have&mdash;namely, limited to six units
of perception per second, but able to look
on, as it were, from outside the Universe,
without himself being affected by any <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>alteration
that takes place in what may be
called the flow of time. Consider some
of the changes he would witness if Time were
gradually eliminated from phenomena. The
inhabitants, who at first were seen walking
by slow, successive steps, would soon be seen
gliding from place to place, the movement of
their legs having passed beyond the sense of
vision; the next stage would see the inhabitants
unrecognisable as human beings when
walking, although they would still be visible
if they stood still, they would be moving too
fast for sight, they would be seen only as
lines or bands extended between their points
of departure and destination; then day and
night would be following each other so quickly
that soon the day would only be a flicker of
light, till, when the week became equal to one
second of the Spectator's time, day and night
would disappear as separate phenomena; then
the week, the month, and the year would in
turn flicker, solidify, or become continuous,
and disappear with all the multitudinous
events contained therein; human life would
then be affected, would flicker, and follow
the same course; to the Spectator the birth
of each individual would become coincident
with his death, and Nations would be seen to
rise and progress towards their destination
without any evidence of individual existence;
the Human Race itself would next succumb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
then the whole of planetary life, then the
formation and destruction of Solar Systems,
then the gathering together and dissemination
of firmaments, and, finally, the beginning
and end of the very Universe would coincide.
Motion, or Physical phenomena, and therefore
Matter, would vanish, and the Great instantaneous
Thought be complete. We seem to
have been able to glimpse from our Watch
Tower, though through a glass darkly, the
whole Truth, and to see that the Infinity of
Time is a figment of our finite senses and is
comprised in the Now. The same treatment,
followed by the same result, may be applied
to the Infinity of Space, and we again see
that all Space is comprised in the Here; it
is only by the conditions of our existence
in this physical universe, <i>insisting</i> on our
analysing everything in Time and Space that
Motion or Change become the very basis of
our Consciousness.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Idea of Infinity is
a necessary result of our finite senses, that
the only Reality is the Spiritual, the Here
and the Now; that the Riddle of the Universe
is not to be solved by the <i>Intellect</i> but
by that method which is employed by those
who are earnestly following the "Quest of
the Grail"&mdash;namely, by realising that our
True Personality or Transcendental Ego is an
